    "abstract": "In this paper we treat mathematical and computational models of thermodynamical systems in complex media as optimal information control problems. Under assumptions of sufficient smoothness on the perturbed Hamiltonian of the system, we propose reformulations of the classical problems using the concept of informational limit. In the general situation, we use Steklov's operator technique to derive generalizations of classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in stochastic, non-smooth, and deterministic cases. We show that a non-conservation law equation appears naturally from such a consideration. For its approximation we use an evolution-associated Markov chain which permits us to derive stability conditions for our computational models. The computational models of this type give a description of generalized dynamical systems (GDS) which include the modeler (decision maker, DM) as an intrinsic part. Several application examples are discussed in the context of multilayered structures such as superlattices where we have to deal with mathematical models with discontinuous characteristics.",

In the study of cell cycles, nonlinear phenomena play a paramount role, in particular in those cases where the cellular dynamics is in the focus of attention. Quantification of this dynamics is a challenging task due to a wide range of parameters that require estimations and the presence of many stochastic effects. Based on the originally deterministic model, in [&nbsp;EJ-130&nbsp;] we developed a hierarchy of models that allow us to describe the nonlinear dynamics accounting for special events of cell cycles. We considered the influence of stochasticity in the analysis of cell cycle dynamics by accounting fluctuations of relative concentrations of proteins during special events of cell cycles and demonstrated that the metabolic events in gene regulatory networks can qualitatively influence the dynamics of the cell cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>Most interesting problems in biological, environmental and materials sciences are multiscale with a range of spatial and temporal scales as discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;]. In solving such problems with atomistic and Molecular Dynamics (MD) tools, an initial topological optimization can lead to a substantial speed up of subsequent computations. New efficient algorithms for such an optimization were discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;] based on several distance geometry ideas. In applying MD tools, we often have to choose between different schemes of stochastic thermostats, e.g. Langevin, Berendsen, etc in such a way that the `fluctuation-dissipation' theorem is obeyed to guarantee the chosen statistics. These tools provide a powerful technique for the analysis of complex biological structures. In [&nbsp;EJ-137&nbsp;] we applied these tools for the analysis of RNA nanostructures where we discovered a phenomenon of self-stabilization. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been proposed as a promising alternative to DNA and proteins for the design of the artificial self-assembled materials at nanoscale (e.g. [1] and references therein). As compared to DNA and some other bio-molecules, RNA offers not only a much greater variety of interactions but also such an important feature as great conformational flexibility of RNA structures. This feature is used by Nature via the ubiquitous catalytic function of RNA, and now it also makes RNA a very promising functional nano-material for the design of the man-made molecular devices and systems. We presented several promising multiscale methodologies for simulation of such biomolecular systems as RNA nanostructures, focusing on the development of a hierarchy of simplified coarse-grained mesoscopic models suitable for the description of such biological nanostructures and details of this can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-145&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>The coarse-graining approach is one of the most important modeling methods in research of long-chain polymers such as DNA molecules.&nbsp;We applied several such models for the analysis of polymeric fluids and relaxation of DNA bio-molecules [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;]. We analyzed the behavour of these systems under different shear rates [&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;], extensional flows [&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;], and provided new results of Brownian dynamics simulations of single DNA molecules in shear flows taking into account the effect of internal viscosity [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;] where our model included the Smoluchowski equation.</p><p>Climate systems models have been discussed by us earlier in&nbsp;[&nbsp;EJ-23&nbsp;]&nbsp;with the error analysis discussion found in[&nbsp;EP-3&nbsp;].

These materials find a wide range of applications in orthodontics and dental biomechanics , optometry, orthopedic surgery, biologically-friendly replacements in body cavities, arteries and other vascular applications, implants, and in various surgery instruments. While there exists a vast amount of literature on constitutive and time-independent modelling of SMAs and SMA-based systems, our main focus over the years has been of the dynamics. This is quite important feature in biological and medical applications of SMAs. Two key technologies are related to this: smart materials and structures technology and nondestructive evaluation technology. The latter includes&nbsp;the development of non-invasive (or less invasive) medical diagnostics.&nbsp;We first proposed a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;] (further discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-93&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems). This allowed to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;EJ-44&nbsp;], with further generalization to include hyperbolicity of heat conduction to follow [&nbsp;EJ-49&nbsp;]. Conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;EJ-53&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-72&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;EJ-100&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-107&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;EJ-111&nbsp;]. A new hybrid optimization procedure was developed and applied in [&nbsp;EJ-118&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;EJ-114&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-82&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-92&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-104&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;EJ-101&nbsp;]. We have also developed several efficient procedures for model reductions in this field based on the manifold reduction, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and the Galerkin projection techniques [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-55&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-106&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-141&nbsp;]. More details on our research into the dynamics of SMAs and SMA-based devices can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Polymers and composites are another class of materials that find numerous important applications in medical and biological science. Some of our contributions to this field can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-78&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;]. We note that that in polymeric materials applied in medical applications there are many non-trivial phenomena that need to be understood much better. We initiated the analysis of one such phenomena known as thermal spiking. We developed a new model for this phenomenon, as well as an efficient method for its numerical solution, and presented results on thermal spiking on an example of bone cement [&nbsp;EJ-45&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-59]. We showed that mathematically such problems are reducible to a coupled system of ODEs and PDE. Other authors used such mixed coupled models for other biological and medical applications, e.g. in vascular remodelling in biological tissues. The techniques we developed may proved to be quite useful in those areas too.</p><p><br></p><p>In the context of environmental sciences, we analyzed models for climate systems [&nbsp;EJ-23&nbsp;] (also proceedings [&nbsp;EP-3&nbsp;]). Climate belongs to the class of systems whose dynamics are only observable in transient states and the resulting mathematical models are characterized by the fact that small-scale phenomena influence the large-scale properties of the modelling system (with the former that cannot be extracted from the latter using available hardware and computational procedures). We provided arguments for such models to be treated as a link between coupled physical processes and computational decoupling with subsequent implications to further climate predictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Our contributions to the development of mathematical models for renewable and alternative sources of energy are described&nbsp;here.</p><p>We are interested in the development of mathematical models for biological and chemical sensors (including those can be used in harsh environments for environmental monitoring), as well as for the field emission as an alternative to the conventional X-ray radiation. In particular, we proposed a series of new multiscale multi-physics models for the evolution of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) on thin films, numerical methods for the solution of the resulting problems, and we reported the efficiency of the proposed models and techniques based on theoretical, computational, and experimental results [&nbsp;EJ-112&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-116&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-122&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-131&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>We developed mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for their solutions for studying the effect of thermal damage induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers [&nbsp;EJ-89&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-96&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-119&nbsp;]. Apart from applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering, this research is increasingly important in biology and medicine in the context of preventing thermal damage of human tissues.</p><p><br></p><p>Piezoeffect in biological tissues has been a subject of long standing interest and controversies. We analyzed this effect in a dynamic setting accounting for the hydration effect in human cornea [&nbsp;EJ-99&nbsp;].

The proposed algorithms provide an effective tool for numerical integration of highly oscillatory functions, especially in the case when a priori information about the problem is given inaccurately. Such a consideration puts us closer to situations which are typical in the solution of practical problems. The developed formulae alow simple computational implementation which is an important feature for the design of software application packages. The importance of the design and implementation of optimal algorithms (and algorithms close to optimal with respect to their computational characteristics) is comparable with the importance of the design and implementation of new computer hardware.

    "abstract": "In many practical problems the norm of the resolvent for the convection-diffusion -absorption (CDA) operator is large as a function of the Peclet number. As a result, conventional spectral analysis may be of limited usefulness for the solution of such problems. Fluid dynamics and electromagnetic theory, along with other areas of applications, provide a wide range of this type of problems. Even if the spatial operator is spectrally discretised, the solution of nonstationary problems requires a temporal discretisation that dictates a typically severe restriction on the method applicability in convection-dominated regions. To resolve these difficulties we develop a new method based on a combination of the Cayley transform technique and an effective iterated mapping. Error estimates for our numerical method are presented.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we analyze propblems of mathematical modeling in microelectronics on the basis of a hierarchy constrated with respect to the relaxation time functions. For the analysis of non-equilibrium and non-local processes in semiconductors, effective numerical procedures based on non-conservative monotone schemeshave been developed, algorithmic realization of the proposed schemes have been proposed, and results of computational experiments on device modeling have been presented. From a mathematical point of view, the models considered in this paper provide an important practical example of stiff systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) with source terms. The availabilityof the conservative property for such systems depends on the definition of the source terms which are always a subject of approximations. If perturbation techniques are applied to such problems, the natural space for perturbations become L1 rather than L2. A challenging problem arises from the fact that the flow map representing the solution of such systems is typically not differentiable with respect to the linaer structure of L1. This leads to majoe difficulties in the analysis of the systems that are described by stiff PDEs, because the contractivity property of the flow for such systems with respect to L1-distance is no longer true in general. As a result, reasonable alternatives to classical and continuous mathematical models for semiconductor device modeling become discrete physics-based topological models, semi-classical, and quantum models. In the development of such models, the role of effective computational techniques essentially increases.",

    "abstract": "Non-smooth dynamic systems appear routinely in many applications of control and game theory. By constructing mathematical models in these fields we often have to deal with evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs), solution of which are not smooth enough to satisfy these equations in the classical sense. A classical example is provided by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations that approximately describe dynamics of value/cost functions which may not be differentiable everywhere. These equations can be formally derived by applying Bellman's dynamic programming approach in a heuristic manner, and much research in control theory has been devoted to the clarification of the connection between this approach and the Pontryagin maximum principle in the non-smooth and stochastic cases. This paper is devoted to the analysis of this connection under relaxed smoothness requirements in non-reflexive Banach spaces and to the approximation of HJB equations in these spaces.The author proposes a unified treatment of non-smooth and stochastic control problems using mathematical models of HJB-type obtained with Steklov's operator technique. Until recently, the analysis of such models has been predominantly conducted in reflexive Banach spaces. The situation has changes since the introduction of the L1 control theory. Due to new and emerging applications of control systems in engineering, non-reflexive Banach spaces become the most reasonable functional classes for perturbations in such problems where control systems have to work in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This paper contributes to the construction and the analysis of approximate PDE models for the description of control systems in such situations. ",

    "abstract": "In many industrial applications we have to deal with materials that exhibit typically nonlinear thermomechanical behaviour. Rubber-like polymers. Rubber-like polymers are one of the most cited examples of such materials. It is not a surprising fact, inasmuch as desirable thermomechanical properties of rubber-like polymers at an economical cost made these materials relatively cheap alternative to more traditional metallic materials in many consumer products, as well as in automotive and aircraft industries. The existing applications of polymers and the design of polymers with improved thermomechanical characteristics require the development of adequate mathematical tools to describethe coupled thermomechanical dynamics of these materials. Although rubber-like polymers provide a classical example where nonlinear effects are essential in the adequate description of material dynamics, only a few recent papers have discussed numerical results obtained for these materialswith general nonlinear models of coupled thermoelasticity. In dealing with the nonlinear behaviour of such materials we must give a proper weight to the fact that nonlinearities in the dynamics of rubber-like materials are closely interwoven with the effect of thermal relaxation time. Mathematical models of hyperbolic thermoelasticity, known as models with relaxation times, are based on hyperbolic-type equations for temperature. Such models deserve more attention than has been accorded in the past. Despite an increasing attention that has been given in recent years to the numerical analysis of nonlinear effects in classical thermoelasticity, the results on the influence of the combined effects of nonlinearity and the thermal relaxation on thermomechanical properties of materials are virtually absent in the literature. However, in many cases these effects become key factors in the adequate description of the dynamical behaviour of thermoelastic systems. In particular, it is well-known that nonlinear terms in the equation of motion and the energy balance equation may lead to the formation of discontinuous profiles of displacement and temperature (shock profiles). In the regions of such discontinuities the combined effects of nonlinearity and the thermal relaxation become significant. From a practical point of view, these effects are especially important in such areas as manufacturing of electronic components and process engineering to name just a few.In this paper we deal with rubber-like solid polymers that, in contrast to many other solid materials such as metals or ceramics, are energy elastic, and since they have relatively large thermal relaxation times, they demonstrate hyperbolic effects in a more pronounced fashion compared to \"hard\" solids. We study numerically a combined effect of hyperbolicity and nonlinearity on the dynamics of such materials. Modelling the thermomechanical behaviour of a ring-shaped body with the Lord-Shulman-type model, we demonstrate an intrinsic connection between nonlinear effects and hyperbolicity of the dynamics. In particular, we show that the vanishing relaxation time can lead to the superposition of nonlinearities. ",

    "abstract": "Polymeric materials and polymer-based composites became an intrinsic part of many new industrial materials technologies where structural engineering and material engineering research go hand in hand. This research relies heavily on the fact that the material from which the end-use structure is made can be \"designed\" in principle and adapted to suit specific engineering purposes. A core component in this research, both from the technological and theoretical point of view, is to be able to extract the information about the macroscopic (thermomechanical, structural) properties of polymers from their microscopic (atomistic) constitution.Since microscopic, atomistically detailed models of materials provide a key to a better understanding of their behaviour at the macroscopic level, the development of such models and algorithms for their implementation become an important activity in industrial materials research, in particular in polymer and composite sciences. The computer-aided molecular design of structures using effective algorithms leads to the situation where compounds and composites worthy of actual synthesis can be effectively identified.In solving molecular conformation problems, stochastic methods based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have become quite popular among the researchers. However, the computer time required for full conformational search by the MD and MC algorithms and many other stochastic search methods (genetic algorithms, e.g.) is often hardly feasible for real polymeric systemsand composites. The situation is not better for the majority of deterministic methods that, due to their exhaustive search of the conformational space, are becoming less feasible computationally when designing complex new material structures. Despite recent progress, all these methods are still computationally very demanding and, most importantly, the success of their applications to realistic polymer systems relies heavily on the choice of initial conformation. Therefore, a real challengefor these types of algorithms is to build plausible initial configurations which can then be relaxed effectively. Although for complex polymeric systems and composites this has often proved to be a difficult task, it has to be tackled in order to provide the real opportunity to design, characterize and optimize these materials before undertaking expensive experimental work. In this contribution we argue that moving towards atomistic simulations of complex polymer systems and composites, another group of stochastic search methods, known under its generic name as distance geometry (DG), will play an increasingly important role. Formulating the general distance geometry problem in atomistic simulation of materials as an optimization problem, we apply two distance geometry algorithms to its solution and analyze their performance for bulk decane molecules. The comparative analysis of the described algorithms in applications to cross-linked polymeric structures is a natural extension of the presented work. ",

    "abstract": "An increasing interest in smart material and structure technology generated by many industrial applications has put a special emphasis on a better understanding of the dynamical behaviour of piezoelectrics as an integral part of this technology. In some such applications piezoelectric sensors and actuators are used as embedded control elements in advanced composites and smart structures that are subjected to severe mechanical and thermal environments. The influence of thermal effects on the dynamic behaviour of piezoelectrics and the coupling between thermal, mechanical, and electric fields are key issues int he analysis of such structures.In this paper the influence of coupled thermal and electric fields on mechanical characteristics of piezoceramic-based devices has been analyzed numerically. On the example of axysymmetric oscillations of hollow thin-walled piezoceramic cylinders it is shown that the thermal field can contribute substantially to such important characteristics of devices as radial displacements. The observed effects become increasingly important in such cases where a piezoelectric has to be considered as a part of a smart structure whose response piezoelectric sensors should monitor, or where the piezoelectric-based device is imbedded into an acoustic interacting media. Although technically non-trivial, mathematically it is relatively straightforward to generalize our numerical schemes to these cases. ",

    "abstract": "Since the phase change in SMA-based devices such as actuators is accompanied by a significant heat exchange with the surroundings, different concepts to heat/cool SMAs have been proposed in the literature. Most of these concepts require the analysis of a multilayered (e.g., \"sandwich\"-type) structure where the SMA layer is placed between layers with another material. In this paper we propose a mathematical model and an efficient numerical method for this analysis. Although our approach can be applied to a wide range of different designs of multilayered actuators, the basic idea of the model construction is explained in this paper for a specific design based on the introduction of semiconductor \"heat pump\" modules into the device and the Peltier effect for the heat exchange. The dynamics of thermomechanical fields is studied with a coupled system of PDEs based on conservation laws. The system, supplemented by constitutive relationships in the Falk form, is reduced to a differential-algebraic (DA) model and solved with an effective DA solver developed in our previous works. Numerical results on thermomechanical behaviour of SMA components in multilayered actuators are presented.",

    "abstract": "Time-dependent convection-diffusion models appear frequently in many branches of computational mechanics including, but not limited to, fluid dynamics and electro-magnetic theory. They also serve as building blocks for many complex applied problems requiring coupling several different physical fields. The development of efficient discretisation methodologies for such models represents a challenging and important area of research in computational mechanics. Earlier we proposed an efficient methodology for the full time-space discretisation convection-diffusion-absorption equations based on the Cayley transform technique. Recently a general framework based on the so-called strongly P-positive operator technique has been developed. Due to its ability to generate exponentially convergent algorithms easily amenable to efficient parallelisation strategies, this framework allows one to construct such algorithms for full time-space discretisations of evolutionary differential equations that have several important advantages over conventional algorithms (including those with polynomial convergence). In this paper we use this general framework to develop further our ideas in the context of time-dependent convection-diffusion problems. In particular, we construct exponentially convergent discretisations for these problems by using an efficient representation of the operator exponent and appropriate quadratures based on the Sinc approximations of corresponding integrals. We note that in this case the resulting quadratures, consisting of a sum of operator resolvents, can be effectively (at almost linear cost) approximated by the H-matrix technique. The situation where the diffusion coefficient is small due to the presence of boundary layers is also discussed. The algorithms presented in this paper admit parallel implementations in terms of both the computation of resolvents and the time stepping. ",

This problem corresponds to the case where a few monolayer InAs grown on GaAs(100) oriented substrates leads to self-assembly of quantum dots with wetting layers as is known experimentally. It is shown that the quantum-dot ground state of the combined structure is considerably affected by the presence of the wetting layer, and similarly, wetting-layer states are affected by the presence of the quantum dot. This quantum dot/wetting layer state interference is expected to have an impact on carrier-capture phenomena and operation speeds of electronic and optical devices using quantum dots as active regions.",

This dynamic coupling is an intrinsic feature of many systems, processes, and phenomena with numerous examples in mechatronics, geophysics, biomechanics, and many other fields. In some cases the interacting components of the system could be structures, fluid, or solid media, as, e.g., in geophysical applications, while in other cases the interacting components could be given in the form of fields such as mechanical and thermal, or electrical and mechanical, invoking a unification of two or more physical theories that have been considered separately before, e.g. thermoelasticity, electroelasticity, hydroelasticity, etc.A common feature of all these problems is that in most practically interesting cases the resulting mathematical models are not amenable to the analytical treatment, and the development of efficient numerical procedures for their solutions is required. In this paper I am interested in efficient scientific computing tools allowing us to adequately describe the complex nonlinear behaviour of materials with memory, in particular shape memory alloys. My main tool will be the centre manifold technique linked together with effective computational procedures for the model construction.",

In recent years, such structures have been grown as they are good candidates for use in active regions of future optoelectronic devices. In particular, we analyzed the qualitative differences in terms of wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues between structures containing the same number of barriers and wells (asymmetrical) and structures where the number of barrier layers is one above the number of well layers (symmetrical). Dirichlet boundary conditions were imposed on the surface of the nanowire structures corresponding to the case where the nanostructure environment is vacuum. We compared our results with those available for the Kronig-Penney model describing infinite NWSLs. Asymmetrical NWSL structures show qualitative and quantitative differences as compared to both symmetrical NWSL structures and infinite periodic NWSL structures. ",

The model is an extension of the previously studied case of dynamic electromechanical vibrations of hollow piezoceramic cylinders, but here we account for the acoustic coupling of such cylinders with the surrounding media. The coupling between three media of distinctly different physical natures brings new features in the analysis of the discrete model. We propose an algorithm for the solution of the operator-difference equations resulting from our approximations. Error estimates for our approximations are discussed in the framework of non-smooth solutions.",

This includes, for example, grid-connected photovoltaic systems that are currently rapidly expanding, providing a viable technology for renewable energy resources [&nbsp;EJ-64&nbsp;].&nbsp;The solar cell industry promises new and clean sources of power and low dimensional nanostructures such as quantum dots play an important role in this industry. A solar cell can convert the energy of sunlight directly into electricity by using the photovoltaic effect.&nbsp;We have developed efficient mathematical models for predicting properties of quantum dots.

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in modelling the shape memory alloy (SMA) behaviour, many difficulties remain due to various limitations of the existing free energy models and strong nonlinearity of these nonlinear materials. Phase kinetics of SMA coupled with thermoelastodynamics is still not fully tractable, and one needs to deal with complicated multiscale character of SMA materials requiring a linkage between their microstructure and macroscopic properties. In this paper we develop a new dynamic model of 3D SMA which employs an improved version of the microscopic Landau theory. Essential properties of the single and multivariant martensitic phase transformations are recovered using consistent steps, which eliminates the problem of non-uniqueness of energy partitioning and relaxes the over-sensitivity of the free energy due to many unknown material constants in previously reported models. We exemplify our results on a model for cubic to tetragonaltransformations in a rectangular SMA bar by showing key algorithmic steps which can be extended to more complex cases.",

In the study of this phenomenon, an important task is to understand how many processes, acting on different temporal and spatial scales, interact in the cell.In this paper we deal with the problem of modelling cell cycles. We start our analysis from the Novak-Tyson model and apply this deterministic model to simulate relative protein concentrations in several different living systems, including Schixosaccharomyces pombe to validate the results. Then we generalize the model to account for the nonlinear dynamicsof a cell division cycle, and in particular for special events of cell cycles. We discuss the obtained results and their implications on designing engineered regulatory genetic networks and new biological technologies.",

These materials find a wide range of applications in orthodontics and dental biomechanics , optometry, orthopedic surgery, biologically-friendly replacements in body cavities, arteries and other vascular applications, implants, and in various surgery instruments. While there exists a vast amount of literature on constitutive and time-independent modelling of SMAs and SMA-based systems, our main focus over the years has been of the dynamics. This is quite important feature in biological and medical applications of SMAs. Two key technologies are related to this: smart materials and structures technology and nondestructive evaluation technology. The latter includes&nbsp;the development of non-invasive (or less invasive) medical diagnostics.&nbsp;We first proposed a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;] (further discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-93&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems). This allowed to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;EJ-44&nbsp;], with further generalization to include hyperbolicity of heat conduction to follow [&nbsp;EJ-49&nbsp;]. Conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;EJ-53&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-72&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;EJ-100&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-107&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;EJ-111&nbsp;]. A new hybrid optimization procedure was developed and applied in [&nbsp;EJ-118&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;EJ-114&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-82&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-92&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-104&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;EJ-101&nbsp;]. We have also developed several efficient procedures for model reductions in this field based on the manifold reduction, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and the Galerkin projection techniques [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-55&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-106&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-141&nbsp;]. More details on our research into the dynamics of SMAs and SMA-based devices can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Polymers and composites are another class of materials that find numerous important applications in medical and biological science. Some of our contributions to this field can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-78&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;]. We note that that in polymeric materials applied in medical applications there are many non-trivial phenomena that need to be understood much better. We initiated the analysis of one such phenomena known as thermal spiking. We developed a new model for this phenomenon, as well as an efficient method for its numerical solution, and presented results on thermal spiking on an example of bone cement [&nbsp;EJ-45&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-59]. We showed that mathematically such problems are reducible to a coupled system of ODEs and PDE. Other authors used such mixed coupled models for other biological and medical applications, e.g. in vascular remodelling in biological tissues. The techniques we developed may proved to be quite useful in those areas too.</p><p><br></p><p>In the context of environmental sciences, we analyzed models for climate systems [&nbsp;EJ-23&nbsp;] (also proceedings [&nbsp;EP-3&nbsp;]). Climate belongs to the class of systems whose dynamics are only observable in transient states and the resulting mathematical models are characterized by the fact that small-scale phenomena influence the large-scale properties of the modelling system (with the former that cannot be extracted from the latter using available hardware and computational procedures). We provided arguments for such models to be treated as a link between coupled physical processes and computational decoupling with subsequent implications to further climate predictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Our contributions to the development of mathematical models for renewable and alternative sources of energy are described&nbsp;here.</p><p>We are interested in the development of mathematical models for biological and chemical sensors (including those can be used in harsh environments for environmental monitoring), as well as for the field emission as an alternative to the conventional X-ray radiation. In particular, we proposed a series of new multiscale multi-physics models for the evolution of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) on thin films, numerical methods for the solution of the resulting problems, and we reported the efficiency of the proposed models and techniques based on theoretical, computational, and experimental results [&nbsp;EJ-112&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-116&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-122&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-131&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>We developed mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for their solutions for studying the effect of thermal damage induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers [&nbsp;EJ-89&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-96&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-119&nbsp;]. Apart from applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering, this research is increasingly important in biology and medicine in the context of preventing thermal damage of human tissues.</p><p><br></p><p>Piezoeffect in biological tissues has been a subject of long standing interest and controversies. We analyzed this effect in a dynamic setting accounting for the hydration effect in human cornea [&nbsp;EJ-99&nbsp;]. Other problems of piezoelectricity, including the issues of existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for the corresponding time-dependent mathematical models can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Several models for the analysis of relaxation of DNA molecules were proposed in [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;] and more information about our research in these areas can be found&nbsp;here. These include also RNA silencing phenomena [&nbsp;EP-67&nbsp;], modelling genetic networks as a multiscale process [&nbsp;EP-37&nbsp;], and the analysis of cell cycle dynamics [&nbsp;EJ -130&nbsp;].</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "abstract": "Dynamics of Phase Transformation (PT) in Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) under the combined effect of stress and temperature is one of the most complex and intriguing phenomena, which is far from completely tractable till date. Propagation of the transformation fronts as they are spontaneously formed and diffused under constraints in the macroscopic structure is one of the important aspects that influence the performance of SMAs as sensors and actuators. The initial state, the transients and the characteristics of stress and the thermal cycles play important roles in the device performance. Investigation of these aspects using crystallographic framework of the constituent materials, and subsequently, tackling the complexities in carrying out numerical simulation in the physical scales constitutes the main theme of this paper. Three-dimensional Gibbs free-energy is derived by consistent partitioning the chemical energy and the transformation energy. In order to perform the time-resolved analysis of real SMA device having truly three-dimensional geometry, a 3D nonlinear finite element model is developed and a large-scale computational scheme is proposed. The variational framework couples (1) the momentum balance (2) the heat\nconduction and (3) the first-order phase kinetics. Numerical validation of this newly developed microscopic model is reported using a NiAl sample.",

Special emphasis is given to the study of quantum-rod shape dependency and consequences for the aspect ratio at the crossing of the lowest two states. The nonseparability of the problem leads to complex ground-state envelope function (and level crossing) and demonstrates the difference between (infinite) quantum-wire structures and finite quantum-rod structures. Finally, calculations are presented for In0.53Ga0.47As quantum-rod structures embedded in InP. It is found that the aspect ratio at crossing of the two lowest states depends on the quantum-rod radius with InP finite barriers. ",

In this paper, we analyze the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin film during field emission under diode configuration. A model of the evolution of CNT thin film is proposed, where the CNTs are assumed to decay by fragmentation and formation of plasma consisting of carbon atoms and impurities. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electrodynamic interaction among themselves are modeled to explain the self-assembly caused by dynamic reorientation of the CNTs. Finally, the nucleation coupled degradation model and the electrodynamic forcing model are employed to estimate the current-voltage characteristics based on the modified Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission. The simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. ",

    "abstract": "Mechanical vibrations constitute a common phenomenon in applications of many engineering structures and systems. Such vibrations should often be tuned according to a specific application. In many application developments, a supplementary oscillator with a suitable frequency is attached to the primary system, by which the primary vibration can be tuned. For the cases where the primary vibration frequency is uncertain, it is always beneficial to make a supplementary vibration frequency continuously variable in a rather wide range. In other cases, when the excitation might not be a mono-frequency or harmonic, or the frequency drifts, the vibration absorber is expected to be robust and still be able to tune the vibration at some extent. In the present paper, we model the performance of a shape memory alloy oscillator used as a vibration absorber. It consists of a shape memory alloy rod and an end-mass. The vibration characteristic of the oscillator is continuously adjustable by changing its temperature, due to the thermo-mechanical coupling property of the shape memory alloy rod. In addition, the first order phase transformation in the SMA rod at low temperatures also contributes robustly to vibration attenuation, due to hysteresis induced. This is can be used for the cases where the vibration and excitation frequencies are unknown, or drift. The dynamic response of the SMA oscillator is modeled by a nonlinear partial differential equation using the modified Ginzburg-Landau theory. This model is then simplified to a nonlinear model convenient for the vibration analysis. Since the SMA oscillator has a very strong nonlinearity, its frequency response is not obtainable in analytical form. We use numerical simulation tools to evaluate its performance. It is demonstrated that the SMA oscillator is able to tune the vibration of the primary system within a rather wide frequency range. The performance of the SMA oscillator is close to a regular linear oscillator at high temperature when only the austenite phase exists. The vibration attenuation of the SMA oscillator at low temperature exhibits a more complicated behaviour induced by the hysteresis effects in the SMA rod.",

    "abstract": "Due to their unique thermo-mechanical properties, the range of existing and potential applications of shape memory alloys (SMA) continues to grow. Many of these applications take advantage of the dynamic response of SMA under dynamic loading conditions. From the engineering design point of view, this requires a better understanding of the effect of phase transformations and thermo-mechanical coupling on wave propagation in the material. In achieving this goal, a fundamental task is to analyse the dynamics of first order phase transformations induced by shock loadings.\n\nIn this contribution, a mathematical model and its numerical discretization are constructed to analyse the wave propagation in shape memory alloy rods. The first order martensitic transformations and the associated effects of thermo-mechanical coupling are accounted for by employing the modified Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire. The Landau-type free energy function characterizes different phases, while a Ginzburg term is introduced to account for the internal friction during phase transformations. The effect of the Ginzburg term on wave propagation patterns is analysed under shock loadings implemented via stress boundary conditions. For practical numerical simulations of SMA samples, the constructed model of coupled nonlinear system of PDEs is reduced to a system of differential-algebraic equations, where the Chebyshev collocation method is employed for the spatial discretization, while the backward differentiation is used for the integration in time.\n\nA series of numerical experiments is carried out on copper-based SMA samples. Propagation of stress waves induced by shock loadings is analysed for different initial temperature. It is demonstrated that the patterns of wave propagation is complicated at low temperatures by phase transformations, while more regular patterns are observed for high temperature distributions. These observations are in agreement with experiments. Finally, the influence of viscosity effects on the overall thermo-mechanical behaviour of rods is analysed numerically by evaluating the contribution of the Ginzburg term responsible for the internal friction during phase transformations.",

This includes, for example, grid-connected photovoltaic systems that are currently rapidly expanding, providing a viable technology for renewable energy resources [&nbsp;EJ-64&nbsp;].&nbsp;The solar cell industry promises new and clean sources of power and low dimensional nanostructures such as quantum dots play an important role in this industry. A solar cell can convert the energy of sunlight directly into electricity by using the photovoltaic effect.&nbsp;We have developed efficient mathematical models for predicting properties of quantum dots. These semiconductor structures have quantum optical properties absent in the bulk material and can be very useful in solar-electric energy conversions. The developed mathematical models can be applied to a range of different materials. Results on Cd-based and GaAs-based nanostructures are given in [&nbsp;EJ-135&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-136&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-138&nbsp;] and [&nbsp;EJ-51&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-61&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-63&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-75,&nbsp;EJ-95&nbsp;] (also proceedings [&nbsp;EP-34&nbsp;]), respectively. Some results on properties of Cd-based nanostructures obtained with first principles calculations can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-123&nbsp;].

    "abstract": "The analysis of dynamics of semi-flexible polymers, such as DNA molecules, is an important multiscale problem with a wide range of applications in science and bioengineering. In this contribution, we show how accounting for internal viscosity in dumbbell-type models may render physically plausible results with minimal computational cost. We focus our attention on the cases of steady shear and extensional flows of polymeric solutions. First, the tensors with moments other than the second order moment are approximated. Then, the nonlinear algebraic equation for the second moment conformation tensor is solved. Finally, substituting the resulting conformation tensor into the Kramers equation of Hookean spring force, the constitutive equations for the model are obtained. The shear material properties are discussed in the context of different internal viscosities and our computational results are compared with the results of other methods applicable for high shear or extensional rates.

These materials find a wide range of applications in orthodontics and dental biomechanics , optometry, orthopedic surgery, biologically-friendly replacements in body cavities, arteries and other vascular applications, implants, and in various surgery instruments. While there exists a vast amount of literature on constitutive and time-independent modelling of SMAs and SMA-based systems, our main focus over the years has been of the dynamics. This is quite important feature in biological and medical applications of SMAs. Two key technologies are related to this: smart materials and structures technology and nondestructive evaluation technology. The latter includes&nbsp;the development of non-invasive (or less invasive) medical diagnostics.&nbsp;We first proposed a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;] (further discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-93&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems). This allowed to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;EJ-44&nbsp;], with further generalization to include hyperbolicity of heat conduction to follow [&nbsp;EJ-49&nbsp;]. Conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;EJ-53&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-72&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;EJ-100&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-107&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;EJ-111&nbsp;]. A new hybrid optimization procedure was developed and applied in [&nbsp;EJ-118&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;EJ-114&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-82&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-92&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-104&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;EJ-101&nbsp;]. We have also developed several efficient procedures for model reductions in this field based on the manifold reduction, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and the Galerkin projection techniques [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-55&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-106&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-141&nbsp;]. More details on our research into the dynamics of SMAs and SMA-based devices can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Polymers and composites are another class of materials that find numerous important applications in medical and biological science.

We note that that in polymeric materials applied in medical applications there are many non-trivial phenomena that need to be understood much better. We initiated the analysis of one such phenomena known as thermal spiking. We developed a new model for this phenomenon, as well as an efficient method for its numerical solution, and presented results on thermal spiking on an example of bone cement [&nbsp;EJ-45&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-59]. We showed that mathematically such problems are reducible to a coupled system of ODEs and PDE. Other authors used such mixed coupled models for other biological and medical applications, e.g. in vascular remodelling in biological tissues. The techniques we developed may proved to be quite useful in those areas too.</p><p><br></p><p>In the context of environmental sciences, we analyzed models for climate systems [&nbsp;EJ-23&nbsp;] (also proceedings [&nbsp;EP-3&nbsp;]). Climate belongs to the class of systems whose dynamics are only observable in transient states and the resulting mathematical models are characterized by the fact that small-scale phenomena influence the large-scale properties of the modelling system (with the former that cannot be extracted from the latter using available hardware and computational procedures). We provided arguments for such models to be treated as a link between coupled physical processes and computational decoupling with subsequent implications to further climate predictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Our contributions to the development of mathematical models for renewable and alternative sources of energy are described&nbsp;here.</p><p>We are interested in the development of mathematical models for biological and chemical sensors (including those can be used in harsh environments for environmental monitoring), as well as for the field emission as an alternative to the conventional X-ray radiation. In particular, we proposed a series of new multiscale multi-physics models for the evolution of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) on thin films, numerical methods for the solution of the resulting problems, and we reported the efficiency of the proposed models and techniques based on theoretical, computational, and experimental results [&nbsp;EJ-112&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-116&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-122&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-131&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>We developed mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for their solutions for studying the effect of thermal damage induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers [&nbsp;EJ-89&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-96&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-119&nbsp;]. Apart from applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering, this research is increasingly important in biology and medicine in the context of preventing thermal damage of human tissues.</p><p><br></p><p>Piezoeffect in biological tissues has been a subject of long standing interest and controversies.

DNA, for example, has four nitrogen-containing bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA molecules form genes found on chromosomes, and genetic frequencies in a population gives us a clue to evolution.

Several models were constructed for this purpose where an important component was the Smoluchowski equation.

However, from mathematical viewpoint, approach towards understanding the physics of nanotube based field emission of a thin film is currently unavailable in the physics literature. A detailed and accurate analysis is important for long-term and efficient performance of the CNT-baseed field emission device. In this work, a modeling approach has been devloped, which handles several complexities at the device scale. From device design point of view, this work sheds light on the coupling issues related to the mechanics, the thermodynamics, and the process of collective field emission from CNTs in a thin film. All the mathematical treatments are combined and solved to calculate the output current using Fowler-Nordheim (FN) equation. The trend in the simulated results matches qualitatively well with the results of published experimental studies.",

Often, the set of differential equations obtained is supplemented with interfacial boundary conditions derived by integrating the differential equations across the interface; however, this leads to a mathematically ill-posed problem as the envelope functions cannot simultaneously fulfill these boundary conditions and the requirement that the Fourier coefficients be restricted to the first Brillouin zone. We show, by way of an example, the origin of these spurious solutions and how to remove them.

    "abstract": "The main idea proposed in this paper is that in a vertically aligned array of short carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on a metal substrate, we consider a frequency dependent electric field, so that the mode-specific propagation of phonons, in correspondence with the strained band structure and the dispersion curves, take place. We perform theoretical calculations to validate this idea with a view of optimizing the field emission behavior of the CNT array. This is the first approach of its kind, and is in contrast to the the conventional approach where a DC bias voltage is applied in order to observe field emission. A first set of experimental results presented in this paper gives a clear indication that phonon-assisted control of field emission current in CNT based thin film diode is possible.",

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown in a thin film have shown great potential as cathodes for the development several field emission devices. However, in modeling these important devices we face substantial challenges since the CNTs in a thin film undergo complex dynamics during field emission, which includes processes such as (1) evolution, (2) electromechanical interaction, (3) thermoelectric heating and (4) ballistic transport. These processes are coupled, nonlinear, and multiphysics in their nature. Therefore, they must be analyzed accurately from the stability and long-term performance view-point of the device. Fairly detailed physics-based models of CNTs considering some of these aspects have recently been reported by us. In this paper, we extend these models and focus on their computational implementation. All components of models are integrated at the computational level in a systematic manner in order to accurately calculate main characteristics such as the device current, which are particularly important for stable performance of CNT thin film cathodes in x-ray devices for precision biomedical instrumentation. The numerical simulations reported in this paper are able to reproduce several experimentally observed phenomena, which include fluctuating field emission current, deflected CNT tips and the heating process.",

    "abstract": "Field emission (FE) from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on a cathode substrate is difficult to characterize using simple formulae or data fitting, which is due to (1) electron-phonon interaction (2) electromechanical force field leading to stretching of CNTs (3) ballistic transport induced thermal spikes, coupled with high dynamic stress, leading to degradation of emission performance at the device scale. Fairly detailed physics-based models of CNTs considering the aspects (1) and (2) above have already been developed by these authors. However, design optimization issues aimed at better FE devices to reduce the extent of electro-mechanical fatigues and improved spatio-temporal localization of emitted electrons remain open and important areas of research. With due success in designing such devices, various applications such as in-situ biomedical x-rays probes and thin film pixel based imaging technology etc., to name just a few, are of great significance. In this paper we analyze a new design concept, wherein (a) the electrodynamic force field leading to strong electron-phonon interaction during ballistic transport and also (b) the usually observed reorientation of the CNT tips and instability due to coulomb repulsions, can be harnessed optimally. In the proposed design, we introduce two additional gates on the edges of the cathode substrate. An array of stacked CNTs is considered on the cathode substrate. The height of the CNTs is such that a symmetric force field is maintained in each pixel with respect to the central axis parallel to vertical axis . As a result, it is expected that a maximum current density as well as well-shaped beam can be produced under DC voltage across the cathode-anode structure. In the present design, the anode is assumed to be simply a uniform conducting slab. However, such an anode can be replaced with a porous thin film along with MEMS-based beam control mechanism. The present design objective is to estimate the field emission current as function of the side-wise gate height dc with respect to the CNT height h and the slope of stacking of the CNT tips. Results show the transverse electric field distribution in the pixel, which directly influences the field emission current. Details of a coupled model involving ballistic transport of electrons, electron-phonon interaction and nonlinear deformation of the CNTs due to electrodynamics forces will be discussed, followed by optimization studies involving the parameters dc/h and Vg/VDC, where Vg denotes the side-wise gate voltage and VDC denotes the DC voltage across the anode-cathode structure.",

    "abstract": "It has been found experimentally that the results related to the collective field emission performance of carbonnanotube (CNT) arrays show variability. The emission performance depends on the electronic structure of CNTs (especially their tips). Due to limitations in the synthesis process, production of highly pure and defect free CNTs is very difficult. The presence of defects and impurities affects the electronic structure of CNTs. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the effect ofdefects on the electronic structure, and hence, the field emission current. In this paper, we develop a modeling approach for evaluating the effect of defects and impurities on the overall field emission performance of a CNT array. We employ a concept of effective stiffness degradation for segments of CNTs, which is due to structural defects. Then, we incorporate the vacancy defects and charge impurity effects in our Green's function based approach. Simulation results indicate decrease in average current due to the presence of such defects and impurities.",

This includes, for example, grid-connected photovoltaic systems that are currently rapidly expanding, providing a viable technology for renewable energy resources [&nbsp;EJ-64&nbsp;].&nbsp;The solar cell industry promises new and clean sources of power and low dimensional nanostructures such as quantum dots play an important role in this industry. A solar cell can convert the energy of sunlight directly into electricity by using the photovoltaic effect.&nbsp;We have developed efficient mathematical models for predicting properties of quantum dots. These semiconductor structures have quantum optical properties absent in the bulk material and can be very useful in solar-electric energy conversions. The developed mathematical models can be applied to a range of different materials.

        "body": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Some of the most important and challenging problems in science and engineering are coupled problems. The coupling is pronounced at three basic levels: </p><ol><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The level of field coupling as it is the case in thermo-elasticity, electro-elasticity and in many other areas of applications</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The level of coupled effects between different parts of the system, and/or</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The level of coupling between different spatial/spatio-temporal scales at which the natural or man-made system, that is being studied, operates. </li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This coupling brings to life new phenomena, the phenomena which are not amenable to an adequate description with conventional mathematical models, traditionally developed without accounting for the coupled nature of the problem. An early observation that the coupling in nature plays a profound role was made by Aristotle who noted that \"the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\" The development of coupled mathematical models has an interesting history with one of the first examples attributed to Pierre Simon Laplace who corrected Newton's purely mechanical theory of sound propagation by accounting for thermal field effects. Another important example includes the development of a dynamic model of coupled electro-magnetic interactions by James Clerk Maxwell. At the M3AI\u00ae Lab, we focus on the development of coupled mathematical models for addressing fundamental questions of science and solving new problems in science and engineering. We study coupled phenomena, effects, and processes that are becoming increasingly important in the areas of nano- and bio-nano technologies, in new technologies based on smart materials and structures, biocompatible materials and bio-inspired systems, and in other areas.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><ul><li class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>Dynamic Thermoelasticity (linear and nonlinear models)</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1 ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>\ufeff</u></strong>As noted, early attempts of creating a theory that would describe mechanical and thermal fields as a unified process go back to P. S. Laplace with his&nbsp;ideas of correcting Newton's purely mechanical theory of sound propagation.&nbsp;However, it is only with the advent of the applications where thermal stresses were becoming increasingly important, the dynamic theory of thermoelasticity was put firmly on the map of research in mathematics and mechanics. In particular, an important modern precursor for the development of coupled dynamic thermoelasticity was laid down by the works of V. I. Danilovskaya who studied thermal stress waves generated by boundary in the early 1950-ies. Most of the works in the field were related to the standard displacement-temperature formulation. We noted that in many applied problems it is the stress components, along with the temperature, are the main unknowns to be determined. As a result, we proposed to solve the problem of coupled dynamic thermoelasticity in the stress-temperature formulation [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-8</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-17</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-41</span>&nbsp;]. Based on the Steklov's operator technique combined with the application of the Bramble-Hilbert lemma, we obtained a priori estimates that were dependent on the solution regularity. A general family of operator-difference schemes for the solution of the underlying problems was derived and convergence of such schemes was analyzed in classes of generalized (weak) solutions. Furthermore, a detailed dispersion analysis for such fully coupled problems was carried out and it was shown that the stability conditions for derived schemes can be obtained with the Cayley transform technique [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-41</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1 ql-align-justify\">We have also been contributing to nonlinear coupled dynamic thermoelasticity. Our main interests here were centered around problems describing multiphase solids such as materials with shape memory and phase transformations. In particular, in order to describe low (martensite) and high (austenite) temperature phases in such materials simultaneously and transformations between these phases, we were using the Landau-Devonshire-Ginzbrurg representation of the free energy function, leading to a quintic nonlinearity in the stress-strain constitutive models. Due to this high order nonlinearity and intrinsic coupling between the equations, the resulting problems are at the forefront of challenges in modern applied and computational mathematics. Our works in this field can be divided into a few groups, (A) to (D).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2 ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>(A) - Model Reduction</u>: </strong>We were interested in the analysis of general three-dimensional (3D) models describing phase transformations, focusing on the development efficient procedures for model reductions. We were the first to propose a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-33</span>&nbsp;] (further discussed and exemplified in [<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-93</span>&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems, with additional examples for SMA patches given in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-86</span>&nbsp;]). This original procedure was based on the center manifold theory. This followed immediately by applications of the reduced model where we were able to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-44</span>&nbsp;]. A generalization of the original model and to include hyperbolic heat conduction effects was also obtained and discussed in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-49</span>&nbsp;]. This generalized model can be also treated with the developed model reduction technique in a straightforward manner. Details of the developed theory for center-manifold-based model reduction of general 3D models for phase transformation in the context of materials with memory were provided in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-55</span>&nbsp;]. Our model reduction procedures based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Galerkin projection techniques can be found in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-106</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-141</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\"><strong><u>(B) - Development of Efficient Numerical Methods</u>:&nbsp;</strong>For the first time, conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-53</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-72</span>&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-100</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-107</span>&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-111</span>&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-114</span>&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-82</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-92</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-104</span>&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-101</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\"><strong><u>(C) - Applications</u>:</strong>&nbsp;The development of models and their efficient numerical solutions in this field having in mind specific physical or engineering systems has been an important part of our research too. Materials with shape memory have applications from aerospace engineering to biomechanics and from medical practices to low dimensional nanostructures. We discussed several applications of these materials in engineering and industrial contexts, where they often have to be treated as multiscale coupled dynamic problems [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-74</span>&nbsp;], in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-42</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-69</span>&nbsp;,<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;EJ-91</span>&nbsp;,<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;EJ-92</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-100</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-107</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-111&nbsp;</span>,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-114</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-117</span>]. More on biological and medical applications of materials with memory can be found&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">here</span>.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\"><strong><u>(D) - Optimization and Control</u>: </strong>A new hybrid optimization procedure for the models describing phase transformations in materials with memory was developed and applied in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-118</span>&nbsp;]. The methodology proposed was based on an initial estimate of the global solution by a genetic algorithm, followed by a refined quasi-Newton procedure to locally refine the optimum. By combining the local and global search algorithms, the developed optimization procedure was demonstrated on several examples. To control such multiphase complex systems as materials with shape memory is a difficult task. This task was undertaken in our paper [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-132</span>&nbsp;] in a closely related context of ferroelectric materials. Theoretical issues of complex systems control were discussed in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-21</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-60</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-129</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\">Most recent applications of coupling between thermal and elastic fields have been explored by us in the context of low dimensional nanostructures [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-135</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-138&nbsp;</span>].</li><li><strong><u>Dynamic Electroelasticity and Electromechanical Fields (piezoelectric effects, linear and nonlinear models)</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Practical applications of electroelasticity theory started at least from the discovery&nbsp;in 1880 by the brothers Pierre and Jacques Curie the direct piezoelectric effect, followed a year later by the works of Gabriel Lippmann on the converse piezoelectric effect. This effect is pronounced by the ability of certain materials to generate an electric field in response to applied mechanical strain. The applicability of such materials is surprisingly large, including a multitude of physical and engineering systems (where crystals, certain ceramics, or piezoelectric polymers are in the heart of their functioning), as well as biological systems, ranging from bones and biological tissues to DNA and proteins.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">The original development of mathematical models in the field of piezoelectricity is largely due to Woldemar Voight and his book on crystal physics published in 1910. Despite many applications of dynamic theory of piezoelectricity, the well-posedness and regularity of solutions of underlying mathematical equations remained open until the late 1980ies. We were the first who succeeded to provide a rigorous mathematical proof of such coupled dynamic models' well-posedness and who analyzed the regularity of their solutions [&nbsp;EJ-3&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-5&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-7&nbsp;]. The main summary of the results are given in [&nbsp;EJ-11&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-22&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-24&nbsp;] and [&nbsp;EJ-31&nbsp;] for one- and multi-dimensional cases, respectively. Efficient variational-difference numerical approximations were also developed at that time with a hierarchy of a priori estimates dependent of the regularity of the underlying solution [&nbsp;EJ-1&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-2&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-6&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-13&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-19&nbsp;]. Those early results were the basis for the development a family of variational-difference schemes for the solution of coupled dynamic problems of electroelasticity describing piezoelectric phenomena, a generalization of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition to the case of coupled electroelasticity, obtained by us for the first time, as well as for obtaining&nbsp;a scale of accuracy results for generalized solutions of such problems and convergence theorems [&nbsp;EJ-22&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-24&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-26&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-29&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-31&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-71&nbsp;] . This provided a rigorous mathematical justification for the application of dynamic models coupling electric and mechanical fields and capable of describing piezoelectric phenomena.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">As a result, our later works in this field were focused on the application of such models to important problems in the analysis and modelling of biological systems (e.g., [&nbsp;EJ-99&nbsp;]), as well as of low dimensional nanostructures such as quantum nanowires, dots, carbon nanotubes (e.g., [&nbsp;EJ-90&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-116&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-135&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-136&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-138&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-146&nbsp;]), where coupled electromechanical fields are of crucial importance.</li><li><strong>Thermoelectricity</strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">The essence of thermoelctricity is a coupling between temperature differences and electric voltage. There are several important effects where thermoelectricity plays a key role, namely the&nbsp;Seebeck,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Peltier effect, and the&nbsp;Thomson effects. These thermoelectric effects have a wide range of applications starting from their traditional cooling applications to their applications in nanotechnology. Our original interest in thermoelectricity was due to modelling issues of SMA actuators&nbsp;[&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-42</span>&nbsp;]. Many problems arising in this context lead to multiscale coupled dynamic models [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-74</span>&nbsp;] and we have continuing interest in developing efficient numerical methods for dealing with such models. In particular, our current interest in the topic is due to the importance of thermoelectricity in modelling low dimensional nanostructures [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-135</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-138</span>&nbsp;].</li><li><strong><u>Ferroelectricity and Flexoelectricity</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">In many materials we observe a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. This phenomenon is known as ferroelectricity. To study this phenomenon is difficult due to the fact that its characteristics are dependent on a range of different factors, including dimensions of the material sample, temperature, surface effects and boundary conditions, etc. Landau theory provides a foundation upon which the mathematical modelling of ferroelectric materials is based. Corresponding (thermodynamic) mathematical models, derived from the expansion of the free energy function, serve as a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic modelling frameworks. Due to contributions of Devonshire specifically in the context of ferroelectric and Ginzburg in the context of finite size ferroelectrics, the resulting models are usually termed as the models of Landau-Devonshire-Ginzburg type. It is these models that represent our main interest in this field.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Ferroelectricity is becoming increasingly important at the nanoscale due to its size dependence. We are interested in this and other similar effects at the nanoscale such as flexoelectricity where the material may exhibit a spontaneous electrical polarization induced by a strain gradient. In fact, recent studies show that low dimensional nanostructures may exhibit nonlocal electromechanical effects such as&nbsp;flexoelectricity. At the same time, despite the recent progress in nanostructure growth techniques imperfections such as defects are practically unavoidable. These imperfections may enhance flexoelectric effects. We analyzed the effects of these imperfections on linear electromechanical properties and on&nbsp;flexoelectricity, focusing on the study of GaN-based quantum dots embedded in an AlN matrix [&nbsp;EP-79&nbsp;].</li><li><strong><u>Coupled Dynamic Thermo-electroelasticity, Magneto-thermo-electroelasticity, Other Coupled Effects</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Mathematical models of thermo-electroelasticity and numerical methods for their solutions were studied in [&nbsp;EJ-39&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-56&nbsp;]. The interactions of piezoelectric structures with fluid media as a representative example of fluid-structure interaction problems were studied by us in [&nbsp;EJ-85&nbsp;]. On a closely related note we have also been interested in interactions of electromechanical fields with acoustic media. Such problems are important in many applications in the classical mechanics setting [&nbsp;EJ-50&nbsp;], as well as in the context of modelling opto-electronic media [&nbsp;EJ-14&nbsp;] where quantum effects may become important. The latter is of interest to us in the context of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures where we also analyzed systematically the influence of thermo-electromechanical fields on the properties of such structures [&nbsp;EJ-135&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-138&nbsp;], as well as the influence of the magnetic field as a control parameter [&nbsp;EJ-146&nbsp;].</li></ul><p><br></p>",

    "abstract": "In this work we analyze numerically the contributions of nonlinear electromechanical effects in nano-heterostructures, focusing on the effect of electrostriction. The main novelty of the present paper lies with the fact that the latter effect has not been analyzed in nano-heterostructures before with multidimensional models.\nWe start our analysis with a continuum three-dimensional axisymmetric model, accounting for complete selfconsistency of electromechanical fields. Although the techniques developed here, can be applied to other material heterostructures, all our examples in this paper are given for GaN/AlN nano-heterostructures. One of the reasons for that is an increasing range of current and potential applications of these nanostructures in optoelectronic devices. We consider in our examples a cylindrical GaN/AlN nano-heterostructure which allows us to reduce the original problem to a two-dimensional model. This reduction goes with a remark that albeit the wurtzite symmetry is not axisymmetric, Navier's equations do reflect axisymmetry [1].\n\nWe note also that recently the analysis of such nanostructures have been carried out in [2]. The analysis was selfconsistent in lattice mismatches, spontaneous polarization, piezoelectric effect, and strain and has been performed by employing a linear (static and dynamic) and nonlinear (static with electrostriction) electromechanical model framework developed there. However, it was restricted to the one-dimensional situation.\n\nIn spite of the belief that a combination of dimensional effects and electrostriction could lead to interesting new physics, the problem was lacking attention partly due to a sparse experimental information on electrostrictive tensor components in the nitrides. Here, due to the availability of experimental information on the electrostriction coefficient connecting the electric field along the z-direction with the strain component, our attention was drawn to only this component of electrostriction.\n\nIn order to deal with the inherent discontinuity of the physical parameters involved and the problem of lattice mismatch, the domain decomposition methodology has been employed for our numerical (nonlinear) analysis. Chebyshev pseudospectral methods have been used for discretization in each sub-domain. Our results demonstrate clear jumps in the electric field and strain distributions across the interface between the two materials, while the mechanical field and electric displacements exhibit a continuous pattern. The effect of electrostriction has been analyzed by comparison of the results with a linear model (without electrostriction). Finally, we demonstrate a significant difference in several key parameters of nanostructures, such as the electric field and strains, while analyzing them with our multidimensional model and previous one-dimensional models.",

Among these semiconductors, cadmium sulfide (CdS), being one of the most important wide-gap semiconductors, is stable and exhibits high luminescence [1]. CdS nanostructures have found many applications in photovoltaic cells, photonic switches and optoelectronic devices. In recent years, CdS quantum dots have also been used in biolabeling, bioimaging, drug delivery and other biotechnological areas. It is due to these optoelectronic and bio-related applications, the analysis of thermal stability of CdS quantum dots becomes one of the most important avenues of research in this field. Additionally, CdS quantum dots represent an intermediate state of matter between molecular species and bulk materials. Therefore, a better understanding of their temperature dependent phase stability and phase transformations will ultimately enable us to taylor their electrical and optical properties from molecular level to bulk crystals.\nIt has been known for a long time that the bulk CdS is highly stable and it exists in the hexagonal wurtzite phase in a wide range of temperatures, from room temperature to its melting point 1750\u00b0C. Recently it has been shown that due to the large surface to volume ratio and reconstruction of surface crystal structure, the thermodynamic properties of the CdS nanostructure can differ significantly from bulk CdS [2]. For example, under appropriate conditions some wurtzite structure semiconductor materials can transform into a graphitic structure when they are in the form of thin nanoplates [3]. Since the internal pressure deduced from surface stress is very large for nanostructures, at ambient conditions, the stability phase in nanosize structures is always a high pressure stability phase struture in bulk [4]. Nevertheless, the temperature-dependent phase stability of the CdS quantum dots remains poorly understood to date. In particular, systematic calculations and comprehensive comparisons of their thermodynamic stability, as well as mechanical, electronic, and optical properties under different temperature conditions are still lacking. To fill this gap, in this work we carry out first-principle molecular dynamic (MD) calculations for CdS quantum dots of various phase structures and study temperature-dependent phase stability of these nanostructures. Based on our calculations, we analyze the relative stability of different CdS phases under different temperature conditions. Our results indicated that at the temperature range studied in this work, the phase stability sequence for the Cd48S48 nanostructure is rocksalt, wurtzite and graphitic phase, which is the same as that of bulk CdS crystal under high pressure. Although the temperature can affect the total energy of the CdS nanostructure, it cannot change the phase stability sequence of CdS nanostructures in the temperature range studied in this work.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a simplified mesoscopic model for the analysis of nanowires of finite length. Our interest has been motivated by the fact that such nanowires can exhibit shape memory effects. This has been confirmed for a wide range of these structures, including ZnO, Cu, Ni, Al, Ag, and Au nanowires.\nHere we focus on a two-dimensional analogue of what in the general three-dimensional case would correspond to cubic to tertragonal or tetragonal to orthorhombic transformations. Such a two-dimensional case deals with square to rectangle transformations which are easier to treat due to the fact that the energy as a function of lattice spacing exhibits two distinct minima corresponding to two different phases of the nanostructure.\n\nMost results obtained up to date, both theoretical and computational, are concerned with infinitely long nanowires or infinitely large nanoplates for that matter. In this contribution, we develop a relatively simple and computationally inexpensive model to study phase transformations in finite nanostructures with our major focus given to nanowires of finite length. We note the models describing shape memory effects at the mesoscopic level such as those developed in [1] can be reduced to a two-dimensional case (and in the case of nanowires of infinite length, to the one-dimensional case). Our considerations are based on a modification of a coupled system of PDEs for the evolution of displacements and temperature [2,3]. One of the applications of the nanowires discussed in this paper stems from their integration in biomolecular technologies and we highlight the importance of the contributions of entropic elasticity in such cases.\n\nRecently, we developed and demonstrated the application of several efficient methodologies to solve two-dimensional models describing square-to-rectangle phase transformations in materials with memory, in particular the finite volume methodology [3] and a numerical reduction procedure based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) [2]. The methodology proposed in this contribution is different and is based on a combination of the Chebyshev pseudo-spectral technique combined with the domain decomposition method and second order backward differentiation. Based on this methodology, we analysed different types of nanowires and examplified our results here with Cu nanowires for different diameter-length ratio. Our results indicate that the initial pattern formation propagates towards the longitudinal boundaries of the structure when the nanowire width decreases. Based on our computational results, we provided an explanation of this phenomenon, confirming that in all cases studied here surface energy suppresses the pattern formation.",

Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of these imperfections on linear electromechanical properties and on flexoelectricity. The constitutive relations for the adiabatically insulated reversible system are derived from the total differential of the general thermodynamic Gibbs potential. The mechanical and electrical balance equations coupled through the constitutive equations are then solved with finite element method for the defective nanostructures.

They exhibit higher magnitudes of electric field compared to other semiconductors in similar contexts. Our results are presented for GaN quantum dots embedded in an AlN matrix. ",

The CNT array on a metallic substrate is considered as the cathode and the test substrate as the anode. Scanning the test Substrate with the cathode reveals that the field emission current is highly sensitive to the surfacefeatures with nanometer resolution. Surface features of semi-circular, triangular and rectangular geometries (projections and grooves) are considered for simulation.

In order to study thermal stress effects on electromechanical properties we develop a fully coupled generalized 3D model. We consider the nanowire superlattices having alternate layers of GaN and AlN in an AlN matrix.  The resulting electromechanical properties are then incorporated in the 8-band k-dot-p Hamiltonian to calculate the bandstructure of GaN/AlN NWSLs. Next, we analyze the effect of various thermal loadings up to 1000 K on electromechanical properties and subsequently on electron localization. It is observed that the thermal loading results in strain in addition to the lattice mismatch induced strain. Since GaN/AlN are piezoelectric and pyroelectric in nature, thermal stresses also have a significant effect on the internal electric field. The thermoelectromechanical properties are observed to modify significantly the bandstructure properties of the GaN/AlN NWSLs.",

Such coarse-grained treatment allows us to reach the microsecond time scale that is by three orders of magnitude larger than that achieved in the full atomistic computer simulations, and thus, to study the slowest conformational motions of the RNA, as well as to enable simulations of the larger RNA structures in the context of bionanotechnology. We find that the variant of the model described by a set of just a few universal parameters is able to describe different RNA conformations and is comparable in structural precision to the model variant where the detailed values of the backbone P-C4' dihedrals taken from a reference structure are included. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the RNA conformation classes based on these dihedrals.",

We use a fully coupled thermoelectromechanical formulation, consisting of balance equations for heat transfer, electrostatics and mechanical field. To estimate the vertical transport current in the heterostructures, we have developed a multi-physics model incorporating thermionic emission, thermionic field emission, and tunneling as the current transport mechanisms. A wide range of thermal (0-300 K) and pressure (0-10 GPa) loadings has been considered. The results for the thermopiezoelectric modulation of the barrier height in these heterostructures have been obtained and optimized. The calculated current shows a linear decrease with increasing pressure. The linearity in pressure response suggests that Al[subscript x]Ga[subscript 1-x]N/GaN heterostructure-based devices are promising candidates for pressure sensor applications under severe environmental conditions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new design configuration for a carbon nanotube (CNT) array based pulsed field emission device to stabilize the field emission current. In the new design, we consider a pointed height distribution of the carbon nanotube array under a diode configuration with two side gates maintained at a negative potential to obtain a highly intense beam of electrons localized at the center of the array. The randomly oriented CNTs are assumed to be grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin film. A model of field emission from an array of CNTs under diode configuration was proposed and validated by experiments. Despite high output, the current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper is focused on understanding this problem. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are modeled to explain the self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Pulsed field emission current at the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation by considering a dynamic electric field across the cathode and the anode and integration of current densities over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. Furthermore we compare the subsequent performance of the pointed array with the conventionally used random and uniform arrays and show that the proposed design outperforms the conventional designs by several orders of magnitude. Based on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the device current history are reported. ",

Our major focus is given to nanowires of finite length and other nanostructures where size effects are pronounced. The main tool used here is based on mesoscopic models developed with the phase-field approach which we and other authors have applied before to study ferroelectrics at the nanoscale. We study the cubic-to-tetragonal transformations in which case the 2D analogue of the model describes the square-to-rectangle phase transformations.

    "abstract": " Many examples of complex systems are provided by applications in finance and economics areas. Some of intrinsic features of such systems lie with the fact that their parts are interacting in a non-trivial dynamic manner and they can be subject to stochastic forces and jumps. The mathematical models for such systems are often based on stochastic differential equations and efficient computational tools are required to solve them. Here, on an example from the credit risk analysis of multiple correlated firms, we develop a fast Monte-Carlo type procedure for the analysis of complex systems such as those occurring in the financial market. Our procedure is developed by combining the fast Monte-Carlo method for one-dimensional jump-diffusion processes and the generation of correlated multidimensional variates. As we demonstrate on the evaluation of first passage time density functions in credit risk analysis, this allows us to analyze efficiently multivariate and correlated jump-diffusion processes. ",

    "abstract": "Phase transformations are ubiquitous in many problems of science and engineering where we have to analyze the evolution of complex nonlinear systems. In this contribution, we focus on one class of such problems that are brought about by smart materials and structures technologies where materials with shape memory effect have found numerous applications at different spatial scales. We provide a brief historical context to the subject, classifications of phase transformations, and their applications. We consider a general three-dimensional model of dynamic nonlinear thermoelasticity, based on a coupled system of partial differential equations derived within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, which we apply to study the dynamics of materials with shape memory and associated phase transformations. We provide details of key mathematical difficulties in analyzing this model numerically. We briefly discuss the most efficient numerical techniques in this context, including conservative numerical approximations based on the modified integro-interpolational methodology where in addition to the interpolation of the solution with respect to independent variables, we also perform the Steklov averaging of nonlinear terms. Our focus is on a mathematical model and its numerical discretization which we construct to analyze the wave propagation in materials with shape memory. From a mathematical point of view, the result is a system of coupled nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations, known as the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire system. The effect of internal friction on wave propagation patterns is analyzed under shock loadings implemented using stress boundary conditions. For practical numerical simulations the constructed model of coupled nonlinear system of partial differential equations can often be reduced to a system of differential-algebraic equations, where the Chebyshev collocation method can be employed for the spatial discretization, while backward differentiation can be used for the integration with respect to time.\nIn the last part of this paper, we discuss a relatively simple and computationally inexpensive model to study phase transformations in finite nanostructures with our major focus given here to nanowires of finite length. We show that in the latter case, the models describing shape memory effects at the mesoscopic level can be reduced to a two-dimensional case and we demonstrate our results on the example of the cubic-to-tetragonal transformations (approximated by square-to-rectangular transformations in the two-dimensional case). Our results were obtained under the conditions of the full coupling between thermal and mechanical fields. This new feature of our model extends recently reported phase-field-based models for studying microstructures and shape memory effects at the nanoscale level where thermal field coupling was neglected. We demonstrated the existence of a critical dimension for finite length nanowires exhibiting shape memory effects. Representative examples of modelling were given for nanowires of different widths showing the importance of geometrical constraints in studying the properties of nanowires.",

The simulations are performed accounting for the thermal effects using the coupled equations of non-linear thermoelasticity. Up to date, these effects have typically been neglected in modeling microstructures at the scales of interest considered here. Nanowires of length 2000 nm and widths ranging from 200 nm to 50 nm are simulated to study the effect of size on the microstructure evolution. There exists a critical width below which the size effect is prominent. We present a series of numerical results demonstrating this phenomenon. We also have carried out the study of variations in values of bulk, shear, and Landau constants to understand the difference in evolved microstructure in the coupled and uncoupled physics.",

    "abstract": "In a series of recent papers we demonstrated that coupled electro-mechanical effects can lead to pronounced contributions in band structure calculations of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures (LDSNs) such as quantum dots, wires, and even wells. Some such effects are essentially nonlinear. Both strain and piezoelectric effects have been used as tuning parameters for the optical response of LDSNs in photonics, band gap engineering and other applications. However, these effects have been largely neglected in literature while laterally coupled quantum dots (QDs) have been studied. The superposition of electron wave functions in these QDs become important in the design of optoelectronic devices as well in tayloring properties of QDs in other applications areas. At the same time, laterally grown QDs coupled with electric and mechanical fields are becoming increasingly important in many applications of LDSN-based systems, in particular where the tunneling of electron wave function through wetting layer (WL) becomes important and the distance between the dots is treated as a tuning parameter. Indeed, as electric and elastic effects are often significant in LDSNs, it is reasonable to expect that the separation between the QDs may also be used as a tuning parameter in the application of logic devices, for example, OR gates, AND gates and others. In this contribution, by using the fully coupled model of electroelasticity, we build on our previous results while analyzing the influence of these effects on optoelectronic properties of QDs. Results are reported for III-V type semiconductors with a major focus given to GaN/AlN based QD systems.\n",

We use the model developed in our earlier work to study the microstructure and mechanical properties of finite length nanowires. The phase field model with the Ginzburg-Landau free energy is used to model the phase transformation based on the chosen order parameter. The governing equations of the thermo-mechanical model are solved simultaneously for different loading cases. We observe that nanowire behaves in a stiff manner to axial load with complete conversion of the unfavorable martensite to the favorable one. The bending load aids the phase transformation by redistributing the martensitic variants based on the local axial stress sign. The nanowire behavior to multi-axial (axial and bending together) is stiffer axially than the axial loading case. The understanding of the behavior of nanowire to multi-axial loading will be useful in developing better SMA-based MEMS and NEMS devices.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a detailed analysis is presented of a quasi one-dimensional parabolic nanowire formed in the plane of a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The nanowire is modulated by a longitudinal periodic potential which has a form of truncated Fourier co-sines. The Hamiltonian of the wire is rotated in such a way that the non-diagonal part of the total Hamiltonian can be treated as a perturbation. Based on the second order perturbation theory, the energy spectrum of the electron spin states of a III-V semiconductor nanowire was found. The analytically obtained energy spectrum was compared to those values obtained from a numerical method. For numerical simulations, the corresponding eigenvalue problem based on the finite element method was solved.\nIt was also found that the energy spectrum curves of the electron with opposite spins differed by one quantum number (i.e., the first and second excited states) cross each other with the accessible values of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. The crossing point was investigated using both theoretical and numerical methods. Next, it was confirmed that the crossing point can be manipulated towards the Gamma or L points with the application of Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. It was demonstrated that the crossing point can be found for relatively larger values of k in GaAs nanowires compared to the corresponding values in InAs nanowires. It is concluded that in GaAs nanowires, the spin splitting energy is mainly dominated by the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, whereas in InAs nanowires, the spin splitting energy is mainly dominated by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.",

    "abstract": "Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) grown on substrates are potential electron sources in field emission applications. Several studies have reported the use of CNTs in field emission devices, including field emission displays, X-ray tube, electron microscopes, cathode-ray lamps, etc. Also, in recent years, conventional cold field emission cathodes have been realized in micro-fabricated arrays for medical X-ray imaging. CNT-based field emission cathode devices have potential applications in a variety of industrial and medical applications, including cancer treatment. Field emission performance of a single isolated CNT is found to be remarkable, but the situation becomes complex when an array of CNTs is used. At the same time, use of arrays of CNTs is practical and economical. Indeed, such arrays on cathode substrates can be grown easily and their collective dynamics can be utilized in a statistical sense such that the average emission intensity is high enough and the collective dynamics lead to longer emission life. The authors in their previous publications had proposed a novel approach to obtain stabilized field emission current from a stacked CNT array of pointed height distribution. A mesoscopic modeling technique was employed, which took into account electro-mechanical forces in the CNTs, as well as transport of conduction electron coupled with electron\u2013phonon induced heat generation from the CNT tips. The reported analysis of pointed arrangements of the array showed that the current density distribution was greatly localized in the middle of the array, the scatter due to electrodynamic force field was minimized, and the temperature transients were much smaller compared to those in an array with random height distribution. In the present paper we develop a method to compute the emission efficiency of the CNT array in terms of the amount of electrons hitting the anode surface using trajectory calculations. Effects of secondary electron emission and parasitic capacitive nonlinearity on the current-voltage signals are accounted. Field emission efficiency of a stacked CNT array with various pointed height distributions are compared to that of arrays with random and uniform height distributions. Effect of this parasitic nonlinearity on the emission switch-on voltage is estimated by model based simulation and Monte Carlo method.",

We also demonstrate that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling may provide appreciable contributions to electronic properties of quantum dots by focusing on gate-controlled electron spins in quantum dots.In particular, we analyze the properties of anisotropic semiconductor quantum dots formed in the conduction band in the presence of the magnetic field. For this case, we formulate the Kane-type model and based on it we study the properties of dots by using both analytical and finite element techniques. It is shown that that in semiconductor quantum dots, the electron spin states in the phonon-induced spin-flip rate can be manipulated with the application of externally applied anisotropic gate potentials. The spin flip rates can be enhanced by such potentials, which can also reduce the level crossing points to lower quantum dot radii. We provide numerical examples providing further insight into these new findings where it is evident that these observed effects are due to the suppression of the g-factor towards bulk crystal. Based on these findings, the phonon induced spin-flip rate can be controlled through the application of spin-orbit coupling. Other coupled effects that affect the electronic properties of quantum dots are also discussed.",

In this paper, we focus on the numerical simulations of microstructure evolution in SMAs using a phase-field model for the two dimensional square-to-rectangular martensitic phase transformations. The phase-field model, based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, has strong non-linearity, thermo-mechanical coupling, and higher-order differential terms and presents substantial challenges for numerical simulations. The isogeometric analysis, developed in this paper using the rich NURBS basis functions, offers several advantages in solving such complex problems with higher-order partial differential equations as the problem at hand. To our best knowledge, we report here for the first time the use of the new method in the study of microstructure evolution in SMAs. The numerical experiments of microstructure evolution have been carried out on the FePd SMA specimen. The results are in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature.",

In addition to thermo-mechanical coupling, the model is characterized by inherent nonlinearity and higher (fourth) order differential terms. The isogeometric analysis, a finite element methodology based on the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) basis functions, offers several advantages in solving complex problems with higher order differential terms. Here we report new results on microstructure evolution for the 3D cubic-to-tetragonal transformations in SMAs. In particular, based on the isogeometric analysis implementation, we present the results on numerical simulations of a SMA domain subjected to externally applied body loads.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the properties of anisotropic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) formed in the conduction band in the presence of the magnetic field. The Kane-type model is formulated and is analyzed by using both analytical and finite element techniques. Among other things, we demonstrate that in such quantum dots, the electron spin states in the phonon-induced spin-flip rate can be manipulated with the application of externally applied anisotropic gate potentials. More precisely, such potentials enhance the spin flip rates and reduce the level crossing points to lower quantum dot radii. This happens due to the suppression of the g-factor towards bulk crystal. We conclude that the phonon induced spin-flip rate can be controlled through the application of spin-orbit coupling. Numerical examples are shown to demonstrate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are used widely in a range of applications, including precision engineering, state-of-the-art bio-medical and nanotechnologies. In precision engineering, these materials are used, for example, for automatic alignment of optical systems. In SMA actuators, we often use hysteresis compensation for high-precision positioning, so that SMAs can be applied for control and vibration tuning of various structures. In vibration tuning in many of these applications, it is often necessary to apply supplementary oscillators to absorb the vibration energy input into the primary system. In this contribution we highlight how, due to the thermo-mechanical coupling, the vibration characteristics of the supplementary oscillator can be tuned by changing its temperature. The basis is our dynamic nonlinear model of SMA oscillator which has been simplified for the vibration analysis. At low temperatures, the SMA oscillator behaves as a regular damper by using its dissipation due to mechanically induced phase transformations.",

The core of the model is given by the phase-field equations that can capture complex thermo-mechanical behaviors of systems at different scales, including martenstic transformations. The model is based on Ginzburg-Landau theory and requires a non-convex\nfree energy function for an adequate description of these materials. While other examples are mentioned, main exemplifications of numerical simulations, presented here, are given for nanofilms.",

Based on our earlier developed models of RNA nanoclusters, in this contribution we analyze the structure and properties of RNA nanotubes in physiological solutions at different concentrations. Our major tool here is the molecular dynamics (MD) method that was implemented by using the NAMD and VMD packages, with which we study the structural and thermal properties of the nanotubes in physiological solutions. In particular, we have analyzed such characteristics as the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), the radius of gyration, the number of hydrogen bonds per base pairs, and the radial distribution function (RDF) of a RNA nanotube at different concentrations of the physiological solution. Furthermore, the number of 23Na+ and 35Cl\u2212ions around the nanotubes within the distance of 5 \u00c5 at two different concentrations has also been analyzed in detail. It has been found that the number of ions accumulated around the nanotubes within the particular distance is growing by small amount while the concentrations of the 23Na+ and 35Cl\u2212ions are substantially increased.",

We exemplify main ideas on a model based on the two-band strain-dependent Hamiltonian in cylindrical coordinates. On the first step of our procedure, the resulting strain-dependent two-band Hamiltonian model in effective mass approximation is solved for wurtzite AlN/GaN QDs numerically. Then the wavefunctions for three lowest levels, obtained from our first step, are employed to calculate the dipole moment matrix elements. Finally, the density matrix approach is used for calculation of susceptibility. The feasibility of controlling susceptibility is studied under the influence of electromechanical effects on quantum dot optical properties. Among other things, we demonstrate that electromechanical effects induce blue shifts in the resonance peak of susceptibility in wurtzite quantum dots under the study.",

In this chapter, we focus on numerical simulations of microstructure evolution of cubic-to-tetragonal martensitic phase transformations in SMAs in 3D settings under the dynamic loading conditions. A phase-field (PF) model has been developed to capture coupled dynamic thermo-mechanical behavior of such SMA structures and the system of governing equations have been solved numerically using the isogeometric analysis. Temperature induced reverse and forward transformations have been applied to a cubic SMA specimen, starting with evolved accommodated martensitic microstructure. We have observed that during the forward transformation, the martensitic variants nucleate abruptly. The transient microstructures are aligned along [110] planes, which is in accordance with the crystallographic theory and experimental results.",

In particular, we show that the strain tensor induce quantum confinement effect that turn to lead the opening of the bandgaps at Dirac point- Such finite band gaps are highly sensitive to the control parameters (period length, applied stress) of the ripple waves that help to design the optoelectronic devices for straintronic and spintronic applications.",

Such waves have their origin in electromechanical effects. With a novel model, we demonstrate that electron-hole band diagrams of GNRs are highly influenced (i.e. level crossing of the bands are possible) by two combined effects: pseudo-magnetic fields originating from electroelasticity theory and external magnetic fields. In particular, we show that the level crossing point can be observed at large external magnetic fields (B \u2248 100T ) in strained GNRs, when the externally applied tensile edge stress is on the order of -100 eV/nm and the amplitude of the out-of-plane ripple waves is on the order of 1nm.",

This study is motivated by a range of applications of photosynthetic complexes, including their increasing role in biomedicine, where our better understanding of their properties become critical. Specifically, in our current study we present the nulcear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the bacteriochlorophyll that is directly taken from the FMO complex, as well as the spectrum for this system for its optimized geometry. We use density functional theory to calculate the optimized geometry and the NMR spectra of the bacteriochlorophyll. From our calculations we found that the chemical shift values are slightly lower for the optimized geometry of the bacteriochlorophyll than the values obtained for the unoptimized bacteriochlorophyll. The differences observed between these two spectra are due to the fact that the unoptimized structure of the bacteriochlorophyll possess the influence of the protein environment of FMO complex.",

In order to expand the applications of these RNA nanoclusters obtained from the self assembly of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) building blocks, it is critical to be able to better understand and predict their properties. Therefore, we model the RNA nanotubes of different sizes using molecular dynamics simulations and then study the mechanical properties of such nanotubes with continuum models implemented with the finite element methodology. We present details of our novel discrete-to-continuum models, and explain how the atomistic models in this field can be used to develop the continuum macroscopic models which would allow to calculate elastic properties of RNA nanotubes using the finite element method. By using the elastic constants available for nucleic acids, we demonstrate how to obtain the distribution of the displacement field due to stress along different directions of the RNA nanotube. These new results pave the road to our better understanding of RNA nanotube stability in biomedical applications.",

A huge improvement in the energy output associated with this new method has been theoretically demonstrated. In the current paper, the influence of different materials on the energy harvesting performance is studied. Firstly, a phenomenological thermodynamic analysis based on a Landau-type elastic Gibbs energy is carried out, which gives a guidance for further investigations. Then, the state-of-the-art phase field model is implemented to study the hysteretic nonlinear phenomena involved in the energy harvesting process. The influence of different materials is carefully compared and discussed. Furthermore, the combined effects of the bias electric potential and bias resistance in different materials are presented and discussed in the context of future real implementations.\n",

For the fully optimized structure of bacteriochlorophyll, we have calculated the NMR spectra by using the same level of DFT approximations, as well as the basis set, as it was done for the original structure.  From the obtained results, we observe that the patterns of the NMR chemical shift are same in both cases, but there is a small shift in the peaks of the NMR spectra for the optimized system from the values of the original structure. Among other conclusions, it is important to emphasize that the effect of the protein environment on the bacteriochlorophyll taken from the FMO complex has a significant effect, as seen from the changes in the NMR spectra. This sensitivity of physical properties with respect to the structural change are very important for our better understanding the applications of photosynthetic bacteria in biomedicine, as well as their limitations.",

    "abstract": "We study the influence of ripple waves on graphene sheets and graphene nanoribbons. Such waves are originating from the electromechanical effects, among other possible mechanisms. By considering variations in the in-plane and out-of-plane displacement vector, we show that the spontaneous generation of ripple waves has no preferred orientation. Intrinsic properties of ripple waves induce a large pseudopotential that in its turn is to induce large pseudomagentic fields that can be implemented into the band engineering of graphene structures.",

    "abstract": "Non-perturbative approaches in nanoscience are discussed. Traditional applications of these approaches cover description of charge transport and optical phenomena in nano-scale systems. We focus on finite-size effects in spin systems near the critical point, based on Monte Carlo (MC) method and some analytical arguments. We have performed MC simulations of the 3D Ising model for small, as well as large linear lattice sizes up to   L=2560 , providing a numerical evidence for a recent challenging prediction, according to which the asymptotic decay of corrections to finite-size scaling is remarkably slower than it was expected before. Our approach along with several other non-perturbative approaches, like, e.g., the non-perturbative nonequilibrium Greens functions (NEGF) method, reveals a potential application of non-perturbative methods to nanoscience and nanotechnology through condensed matter physics, including semiconductor physics and physics of disordered systems like spin glasses.",

Using mathematical modeling tools to study microstructures can predict the behaviors of material under applied fields. In the current paper, a 1-D dynamic isothermal model is proposed to simulate the microstructure of SMA via Legendre wavelets collocation method. Because of the good performance of Legendre wavelets basis, this method shows good properties in both precision and stability. This paper gives a detailed numerical algorithm and employs the backward differentiation formula to perform all simulations. Computational simulations are carried out in both static and dynamic systems to study the stress induced phase transformation (PT). Numerical experiments are performed using different grids in this paper to demonstrate the advantages of reduced computing cost of the proposed method. In addition, good convergence of the method is well illustrated by the numerical results. The microstructure of SMA is well captured in the current paper.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a parametric study has been conducted to evaluate the effects of frequency and duration of the short burst pulses during pulsed radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating chronic pain. Affecting the brain and nervous system, this disease remains one of the major challenges in neuroscience and clinical practice. A two-dimensional axisymmetric RFA model has been developed in which a single needle radiofrequency electrode has been inserted. A finite-element-based coupled thermo-electric analysis has been carried out utilizing the simplified Maxwell\u2019s equations and the Pennes bioheat transfer equation to compute the electric field and temperature distributions within the computational domain. Comparative studies have been carried out between the continuous and pulsed RFA to highlight the significance of pulsed RFA in chronic pain treatment. The frequencies and durations of short burst RF pulses have been varied from 1 Hz to 10 Hz and from 10 ms to 50 ms, respectively. Such values are most commonly applied in clinical practices for mitigation of chronic pain. By reporting such critical input characteristics as temperature distributions for different frequencies and durations of the RF pulses, this computational study aims at providing the first-hand accurate quantitative information to the clinicians on possible consequences in those cases where these characteristics are varied during the pulsed RFA procedure. The results demonstrate that the efficacy of pulsed RFA is significantly dependent on the duration and frequency of the RF pulses.",

    "abstract": "The present study aims at evaluating the effects of target nerve location from the bone tissue during continuous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for chronic pain relief. A generalized three-dimensional heterogeneous computational model comprising of muscle, bone and target nerve has been considered. The continuous RFA has been performed through the monopolar needle electrode placed parallel to the target nerve. Finite-element-based coupled thermo-electric analysis has been conducted to predict the electric field and temperature distributions as well as the lesion volume attained during continuous RFA application. The quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell\u2019s equations has been used to compute the electric field distribution and the Pennes bioheat equation has been used to model the heat transfer phenomenon during RFA of the target nerve. The electrical and thermo-physical properties considered in the present numerical study have been acquired from the well-characterized values available in the literature. The protocol of the RFA procedure has been adopted from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved commercial devices available in the market and reported in the previous clinical studies. Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity along with the piecewise model of blood perfusion have been considered to correlate with the in-vivo scenarios. The numerical simulation results, presented in this work, reveal a strong dependence of lesion volume on the target nerve location from the considered bone. It is expected that the findings of this study would assist in providing a priori critical information to the clinical practitioners for enhancing the success rate of continuous RFA technique in addressing the chronic pain problems of bones.",

Current lead-free composites lag state-of-the-art lead-based composites in terms of performance. A major\napproach to bridge this gap is to devise design strategies to enhance the piezo-response of lead-free composites. Fundamental to this is the understanding of the roles of various physical\nprocesses which are conventionally overlooked. From a modelling perspective, it is necessary\nto develop refined models which account for non-local and non-linear effects, which could have significant roles in deciding the response of the composite. This paper develops such refined electro-elastic models considering the flexoelectric and electrostrictive contributions to the piezo-response in addition to the linear piezoelectric response. The roles of these non-local and non-linear contributions are studied on a simple architecture consisting of a BaTiO3 inclusion within a polymer matrix. Insights obtained through this model will be further used to develop efficient piezoelectric composites.",

Finite-element-based simulations have been performed for computing the temperature and electrical field distributions during the continuous RF procedures for treating chronic pain.

However, the development of lead-free piezoelectric materials is attracting great attention in recent years, with the aim of enabling technologies that are environmentally friendly. This paper discusses the computational design of microstructured lead-free polymer-based piezoelectric nanocomposites suitable for production by 3D printing. Results are presented and further analyzed for various configurations using BaTiO3 inclusions in polymeric matrices enriched with the addition of carbon nanotubes (CNT). By incorporating carbon nanotubes in the matrix, we anticipate a quite significant improvement in the piezoelectric response of the composite, through simultaneous hardening of the matrix and improvement in its permittivity.",

A three-dimensional continuum-based hollow cylindrical domain of a microtubule has been considered in this work. A fully coupled electro-mechanical model has been developed for conducting the comparative analysis considering three different cases, viz., no degradation, 50% degradation and 90% degradation of elastic modulus of the microtubule. The microtubule has been subjected to dynamic forces adopted from the commonly used loading-unloading conditions in nanoindentation experiments. The results show that the degradation of microtubules significantly influences their electro-elastic response when subjected to externally applied forces. The transient response of the model in terms of induced displacement, electric potential and volumetric strain has also been analyzed for different magnitudes of mechanical degradation. The modelling study presented here represents a more accurate electro-mechanical model compared to the classical mechanical model for quantifying the effects of mechanical transductions on microtubules biomechanics.",

    "abstract": "In this contribution, the coupled electro-mechanical behavior of the microtubules has been systematically investigated utilizing a continuum-based finite element framework. A three-dimensional computational model of a microtubule has been developed for predicting the electro-elastic response of the microtubule subjected to external forces. The effects of the magnitude and direction of the applied forces on the mechanics of microtubule have been evaluated. In addition, the effects of variation of microtubule lengths on the electro-elastic response subjected to external forces have also been quantified. The results of numerical simulation suggest that the electro-elastic response of microtubule is significantly dependent on both the magnitude and direction of the applied forces. It has been found that the application of shear force results in the attainment of higher displacement and electric potential as compared to the compressive force of the same magnitude. It has been further observed that the output potential is linearly proportional to the predicted displacement and the electric potential within the microtubule. The increase in the length of microtubule significantly enhances the predicted piezoelectric potential under the application of different forces considered in the present study. It is expected that the reported findings would be useful in different avenues of biomedical engineering, such as biocompatible nano-biosensors for health monitoring, drug delivery, noninvasive diagnosis and treatments.",

    "abstract": " The application of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely explored in treating various types of cardiac arrhythmias. Computational modelling provides a safe and viable alternative to ex vivo and in vivo experimental studies for quantifying the effects of different variables efficiently and reliably, apart from providing a priori estimates of the ablation volume attained during cardiac ablation procedures. In this contribution, we report a fully coupled thermo-electro-mechanical model for a more accurate prediction of the treatment outcomes during the radiofrequency cardiac ablation. A numerical model comprising of cardiac tissue and the cardiac chamber has been developed in which an electrode has been inserted perpendicular to the cardiac tissue to simulate actual clinical procedures. Temperature-dependent heat capacity, electrical and thermal conductivities, and blood perfusion rate have been considered to model more realistic scenarios. The effects of blood flow and contact force of the electrode tip on the efficacy of a fully coupled model of RFA have been systematically investigated. The numerical study predicts that the efficacy of RFA is significantly dependent on the thermo-electro-mechanical parameters of the cardiac tissue. ",

The mathematical  model is based on the nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beamtheory. The developedmodel is solved by using the Finite DifferenceMethod (FDM). As a result of this solution, the frequency response of the nanowire resonator has been obtained. Then, based on the developed numerical solution, a parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effects of different parameters on the vibration of nanowire resonators.

A study has been conducted to quantify the effects of varying extracellular potassium concentrations  on the propagation of CSD in the multiscale reaction-diffusion model by monitoring the respective changes in the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of sodium, chlorine and calcium ions, in addition to evaluating the changes in the generated membrane potentials. In the multiscale neuronal model, the influence of gated conductance on the intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations of the sodium and potassium and the membrane potential has been reported. The study revealed that the variation in gated conductance results in an increase of the pump currents that leads to the spatio-temporal variations of extracellular potassium.",

During this procedure, part of dysfunctional tissues is ablated by using the heat, typically generated from medium frequency electric current. It is a field of medicine where mathematical and computational models play a substantial role in assisting clinical practitioners with quantifications of some of the most critical characteristics, including temperature distributions and ablated volumes. In this contribution, we describe a framework for the development of coupled thermo-electro-mechanical models in this field. While our framework and the described validation procedures can be applicable to a variety\nof ablation modalities and treatments, a major focus has been given to some of the particularities related to cardiac ablation at tissue-cellular scales and a role played by cell organelles such as microtubules, as well as by the cell nucleus. We have discussed the effects their inclusion makes on the calculation of the main characteristics of the radiofrequency ablation procedures. The importance of domain heterogeneity, as well as the integration of fluid-structure interaction in the developed framework along with other effects, have been highlighted and the details on ablation modalities in the context of clinical experimental\nresearch have been given. Finally, future generalizations of the proposed framework with hybrid stochastic-deterministic models have been put forward.\n",

In particular, it is well known  that  along  with  amyloid-beta,  the  tau  protein  is  also  drivingAlzheimer\u2019s disease. Multiscale reaction-diffusion models can assist in our better understanding of the evolution of the disease. Based on a coarse-graining procedure of the continuous model and taking advantage of the brain data connectome, a computationally challenging network mathematical model has been described where the edges of the network are the axonal bundles in white-matter tracts. Further, we have modified the heterodimer model in such a way that it can now capture some of nthe critical characteristics of this evolution such as the conversion time from healthy to toxic proteins. Finally, we have analyzed the modified model theoretically and validated the theoretical findings with numericalsimulations.",

    "abstract": "To model reliably behavioral systems with complex bio-social interactions,accounting for uncertainty quantification, is critical formany application areas. However,in terms of the mathematical formulation of the corresponding problems, one of the ma-jor challenges is coming from the fact that corresponding stochastic processes should, inmost cases, be considered in bounded domains, possibly withobstacles. This has beenknown for a long time and yet, very little has been done for thequantification of uncer-tainties in modelling complex behavioral systems described by such stochastic processes.In this paper, we address this challenge by considering a coupled system of Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describing interactions between active andpassive participants of a mixed-population group.  In developing a multi-fidelity mod-elling methodology for such behavioral systems, we combinelow- and high-fidelity resultsobtained from (a) the solution of the underlying coupled system of SDEs and (b) simu-lations with a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kineticMonte Carlo procedure. Furthermore, we provide representative numerical examples ofhealthcare systems, subject to an epidemic, where the main focus in our considerationsis given to an interacting particle system of asymptomatic and susceptible populations.",

    "abstract": "In this contribution, we study the properties of new promising graphenebased materials with shape memory effects. While traditional shape memory alloys have been extensively studied, it is a challenge to preserve shape memory properties at the nanoscale. As a result, new materials have been explored, among which graphene oxide (GO) crystals with ordered epoxy groups where a recoverable strain of 14.5% has already been reported. We use such nanoscale GO structures as a benchmark example for our studies here. MBTR and SOAP representations are employed in a general-purpose ML model to analyze the effect of long-range interactions in GO. Finally, a physics-based ML model allows us to build interatomic potentials for 2D and 1D systems. The model predicts quantum mechanical effects due to the electronic confinement in narrow nanoribbons and shows the evolution of the local minimal energies associated with two-phase states.",

    "abstract": "We take a heterodimer multiscale reaction-diffusion model as a starting point\nand modify it to account for the nonlocality of the underlying processes. The resulting model is a coupled system of integro-differential equations. The effect of nonlocal\ninteractions is quantified based on the comparisons of the newly developed model with\nits local counterpart. Our primary focus is given to the estimation of conversion times\nfrom healthy to toxic proteins. This is done based on the stability analysis of a simplified\nmodel, as well as on the fully coupled numerical implementation. Several clinically relevant patient proteopathies are highlighted. They include the primary tauopathy, as well\nas the secondary tauopathy where the sustained presence of toxic tau protein requires\nalso to be accompanied by toxic amyloid-beta peptides. We demonstrate the dynamics\nof concentrations of toxic proteins under several clinically realistic scenarios. Finally, we\ncarry out a detailed parametric study, providing further insight into the role of nonlinear\neffects controlled via the Holling type II functional response",
