The variational difference scheme, obtained with the proposed methodology, provides a way to conserve the properties of the original dynamic differential model on the grid. ",

    "abstract": "When formulating mathematical models for many problems in electronics, such as for the analysis of thermal conditions of integrated circuits (IC), we often have to deal with situations where relaxed regularity assumptions on the a priori unknown solutions are required. Indeed, in the analysis of IC thermal conditions, thermal characteristics of elements located on the curcuit are usually different. Another challenge in mathematical electronics lies with the fact that we often have to deal with multi-dimensional mathematical models and therefore the development of efficient numerical approximations for such models in this field is essential. The method of summary approximation provides a way to develop such approximations. It allows us to reduce the problem to additive difference schemes, or more generally to additive vector schemes, for both steady-state and time-dependent problems with general types of boundary conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method in the context of problems of thermal management of ICs.",

    "abstract": "Thermal conditions of integrated microcircuits play a fundamental role in developing more reliable electronic components and devices. The well-known problem of \"self-heating\" of electronic components and devices leads to serious limitations of a degree of integration of electronic elements on the substrate. As a result, IC thermal conditions will largely determine further progress in the field of electronics. Mathematically, problems of determing thermal conditions of integrated circuits can be reduced to solving partial differential equations. In this contribution, we show how to decrease the number of iterations for achieving a pre-defined accuracy in typical problems of calculating IC thermal conditions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed mathematical model, developed under the assumption of smallness of the substrate thickness compared to its geometric dimensions in the topology plane, can effectively take into account different practical ways of IC substrate mounting in electronic applications.

In this paper, this missing link has been filled. With the use of the Faedo-Galerkin method, the existence, uniqueness and regularity of generalized solutions to the corresponding initial-boundary value problem have all been proved.

For the numerical solution of the resulting mathematical model we propose a difference scheme, developed by taking into account the coupling effects between different physical fields which are essential in the analysis of acousto-electronic wave interactions in layered media.

We analyse dispersion properties of a difference scheme for our model and derive conditions which allow us to achieve a better correspondence between dispersion characteristics of difference and differential problems. By using the Cayley transform and the obtained dispersion relationship, we also derive stability conditions for the difference scheme based on geometric considerations. ",

A spectral Galerkin method is used to accurately resolve spatial structures of temperature and displacement. A sequence of solutions is obtained for gradually increasing initial amplitude of the thermoelastic wave, showing a transition from a steady harmonic wave to singular solutions. Larger values of the relaxation time are shown to result in smoother temperature profiles. The dynamics generated by a localised heat release from an external source is studied. It is observed that the source excites a standing-like wave of the displacement while temperature monotonically decays.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of piezoelectric solids is studied computationally with a mathematical model coupling the equation of motion, the Maxwell equation for electric field and the energy balance equation. The main results are reported for (hollow) cylindrical piezoelectric elements with radial preliminary polarization where a strong effect of thermo-electromechanical coupling is amplified by the mechanical boundary conditions for stresses. Such elements (and the associated models allowing computations of their dynamics under different thermo-electromechanical loading conditions) become increasingly important not only in the traditional applications of piezoelectrics such as piezotransducers, but also in the context of smart materials and structures applications. Based on the variational approach and theory of generalized solutions efficient numerical schemes for a fully coupled model have been developed. Computational results are presented for a hollow cylindrical element made of PZT-5A piezoceramics.",

    "abstract": "Many problems in applications of piezoelectric materials are essentially time-dependent, and a conventional treatment of such problems with analytical and semi-analytical techniques based on the analysis of harmonic oscillations become inadequate in those cases where a complete dynamic picture of electromechanical energy transfer is required. For such situations we have developed an efficient explicit numerical methodology allowing us to compute dynamic electromechanical characteristics of piezoelectric structures and devices under various loading conditions. We show that the stability conditions for our numerical approximation can be obtained from a discrete conservation law, and be cast in a form similar to that of the classical CFL condition. However, in our case the velocities of wave propagation, participating in the formulation of the stability conditions, are clearly dependent on the pattern of electromechanical coupling. Our discussion here is centered around finite piezoelectric shells of cylindrical shape and we present several results of computational experiments where both weak and strong couplings are discussed.

The major attention has been given to the case of radial preliminary polarisation of piezoceramics where a strong coupling between electric and mechanical fields is an essential feature of the dynamics. An efficient numerical discretisation scheme based on the integro-interpolation approach has been proposed and representative examples of computational experiments are given.",

    "abstract": "In developing electric machines in general, and induction motors in particular, temperature limits is a key factor affecting the efficiency of the overall design. Since conventional loading of induction motors is often expensive, the estimation of temperature rise by tools of mathematical modelling and computational experiments becomes increasingly important. In the present paper we develop and validate experimentally a model accounting for losses and describing thermal phenomena in induction motors. The developed model has been implemented in FEMLAB, and has been applied to predict temperature rise in totally enclosed fan-cooled induction motors. Comparisons with experimental results obtained with a 1.5 kW standard squirrel-cage induction motor show the effectiveness of the developed model in predicting temperature rise for a range of operating conditions, in particular for different frequencies and voltages. Finally, a SIMULINK-based control loop has been developed by using the thermal model as an input.",

    "abstract": "The so-called $\\mu-\\lambda$ curves, where $\\lambda$ is the slip ratio and $\\mu$ is the normalised traction force or the friction index, are nonlinear functions of the velocity of the vehicle and the wheel rotational velocity. Despite their predominant use in the literature, linear approximations of such curves may fail to predict correctly key characteristics of vehicle performance efficiency such as torque-speed profiles. Although attempts to model these characteristics in the context of slip phenomena have been made before, to our best knowledge a general model with respect to the vehicle velocity, the wheel rotating velocity, the slip ratio, the traction force, and the torque, has never been formulated and solved as a coupled nonlinear problem based on a system of differential-algebraic equations arising naturally in this context. In this paper, such a model is formulated, solved numerically, and some results of numerical simulation of driving an electric vehicle on different surface conditions are presented.",

The same scheme is applied in our code for the general case. Then, we describe a systematic approach to modelling SMA materials, and demonstrate that approach in deriving a centre-manifold-based low-dimensional model from the general three-dimensional model, preserving all main features of the dynamics.

We provide modelling results demonstrating that thermal fields can influence significantly on the characteristic (electromechanical) properties and the performance of piezoelectric elements and structures.

One of the major processing techniques for producing such structures is the curing process. This process may be accompanied by undesirable thermal spiking phenomena during which the released energy may be trapped inside of the structure. In order to predict the onset of this phenomenon models that couple reaction kinetics and heat transfer are required. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for the solution of such coupled problems. The algorithm is based on the alternating-triangular methodology which is more efficient compared to ADI methodologies conventionally applied to similar problems. The algorithm is described in detail. The results for simulations of reaction kinetics are compared with those obtained in the literature from experimental measurements. A series of numerical experiments for the fully coupled system are also presented.",

These objects are already grown experimentally in laboratories and studies of their properties represent an important task in nanotechnology research. Tools of mathematical modelling provide a powerful means for studying these fascinating structures with an ultimate goal of predicting their properties and understanding their limits. In this paper, we analyse finite nanowire GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As superlattice structures with a cylindrical cross-section and determine their electronic eigenstates and energy eigenvalues. We analyse in detail the qualitative differences, in terms of wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues, between structures containing the same number of barriers and wells (asymmetrical) and structures where the number of barrier layers is one above the number of well layers (symmetrical). We demonstrate that asymmetrical NWSL structures have well-pronounced qualitative and quantitative differences as compared to both symmetrical NWSL structures and infinite periodic NWSL structures. We show also that there exists a critical radius R-c for quantum confinement, that is the NWSL ground state is confined in GaAs (Al0.3Ga0.7As) for a nanowire of radius R above (below) R-c. In the specific case where R = R-c, the ground state is smeared out over the entire NWSL structure.",

Such systems are utility interactive and one of the major difficulties in their efficient use is related to islanding phenomena connected with a possibility of supplying surplus power back to the utility grid. In detecting and preventing such situations, anti-islanding protection devices play a paramount role. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques in order to identify a methodology with an optimum combination of characteristics. We implement the chosen methodologies in SIMULINK. Major attention is given to the phase jump detection method (PJD), and to the slip mode frequency shift method (SMS) for which we provide a detailed description of our SIMULINK implementations and their evaluations performed on the basis of their nondetection zones. We develop an experimental iterative scheme to validate the results of computational experiments obtained with the developed models, and report the results of several computational tests.",

These structures are produced today with advances of QD growth technology, and computational tools are fundamental in providing a better understanding of such structures. In this paper QD nanostructures are analysed with due account for coupling effects between electronic states in the dot and the wetting layer regions. The analysis, performed on the basis of the finite element methodology and Arnoldi iterations, demonstrates that the effect of coupling may be essential. The numerical procedure applied here is more efficient compared to the QR algorithm typically used in the context of modelling low-dimensional nanostructures. We report results of computational experiments for cylindrical and truncated conical QDs and compare them with the earlier results obtained for fully conical QD nanostructures.",

The model is not amenable to analytical treatments and the development, analysis, and applications of effective numerical approximations for this model is in the focus of the present paper. In particular, we discuss a recently proposed fully conservative difference scheme for the solution of the problem. We note that a standard energy inequality technique, applied to the analysis of convergence properties of the scheme, would lead to restrictive assumptions on the grid size and/or excessive smoothness assumptions on the unknown solution. We show how such assumptions can be removed to achieve unconditional convergence of the proposed scheme. Next, we apply the proposed scheme to the analysis of behaviour of a shape memory alloy rod. We demonstrate that the proposed approximation can describe a complete range of behaviour of the shape memory material, including quasiplastic, pseudoelastic, and almost elastic regimes. We discuss the influence of nonlinear effects in each of these regimes focusing on hysteresis effects.",

Contrary to earlier work, the aspect ratio at crossing is found to be shape but not size dependent, and it is shown that the nonseparability and multiband nature of the problem leads to a complex ground-state envelope function and also to the phenomenon of level crossing. The intrinsic difference between the valence states of a quantum rod and those of a quantum wire is demonstrated. ",

From a mathematical point of view, the problem in hand is a coupled dynamic system of partial differential equations which is not amenable to analytical treatments and requires an efficient computational tool for its solution. The developed methodology is based on a combination of the analysis of such invariant sets that keep the essentials of the system dynamics and on the reduction procedures of the original model on such sets. A presented numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the developed tool in describing phase transformations in actuators based on materials with shape memory effects.",

    "abstract": "The influence of wetting-layer states on quantum-dot states and vice versa is analysed numerically for electrons in the conduction band in the general case with arbitrary kinetic energy in the plane of the quantum-well wetting layer. Since the analysed quantum dot is embedded in a barrier material with different properties, the effective mass approximation methodology leads to a Schrodinger model with discontinuous coefficients. This complicates the analysis and, in addition, requires a special attention to the formulation of boundary conditions for the entire structure, consisting of the quantum dot with wetting layer embedded in a barrier material. In the present paper, the complete model is formulated and solved numerically via a variational approach based on finite element approximations and Arnoldi iterations. By analysing different geometrical configurations, we demonstrate that the ground eigenstate of the entire structure can be considerably affected by the presence of the wetting layer. The dependency demonstrated between eigenstates of the 'pure' quantum dots and the quantum-well wetting layers indicates that a conventional analysis of quantum-dot structures without accounting for wetting layers may not be sufficient for an adequate characterization of quantum dots as active regions in future electronic and optical devices.",

The main advantages of this theory are its non-linearity, continuous nature (computationally inexpensive), and anisotropy (includes the crystal structure). The theory allows us to account explicitly for internal strain and for realistic interface boundary conditions. The discussion is restricted to cases where the strain is nearly constant on the length scale of the primitive lattice cell except at interfaces where discontinuities are allowed. The main idea behind the theory presented here is to include as much information on the atomic structure in the continuous limit as it is necessary in order to accurately describe nanoscale systems. To illustrate the importance of non-linear effects and the inclusion of internal strain, we present some simple calculation for quantum wells with diamond crystal structure oriented in the [111] direction.",

Particular emphasis has been placed on high- frequency and short spatial variations of temperature and displacement, in which the role of nonlinearities in the dynamics of the material and their close connection with the effect of thermal relaxation time can be best appreciated. It is shown how the vanishing relaxation time can lead to an attenuation of nonlinear effects in the thermomechanical system.",

Nevertheless, their influence is typically analyzed with simplified linear models based on the minimization of uncoupled, purely elastic energy functionals with respect to displacements.

This method is used to derive a second-order approximation both for the strong and weak formulations of the eigenvalue problem. The weak formulation is needed in order to allow deformations that have discontinuous first derivatives at interfaces between different materials. It is shown that, as long as the deformation is twice differentiable away from interfaces, the weak formulation is equivalent to the strong formulation with appropriate interface boundary conditions. It is also shown that, because the Jacobian of the deformation appears in the weak formulation, the approximations of the weak formulation is not equivalent to the approximations of the strong formulation with interface boundary conditions. The method is applied to two one-dimensional examples (a sinusoidal and a quantum-well potential) and one two-dimensional example (a freestanding quantum wire), where it is shown that the energy eigenvalues of the second-order approximations lie within 1% of the exact energy eigenvalues for a linear strain of up to 9.8%, whereas the first-order approximation has an error of less than 1% for a linear strain of up to 5.5%.",

Main results are presented for radially polarized piezoceramic, PZT5 elements of hollow cylindrical shapes. The coupling in the radial direction between the solid and the acoustic media is accounted for indirectly, via impedance boundary conditions. The model based on such impedance boundary condition approximations offers a robust simplified alternative to a full scale fluid-solid interaction modelling. By using this model, we analyse numerically the influence of the boundary conditions imposed in the axial direction for long, medium, and short (disk-like) piezoceramic elements.",

Furthermore, we have found that, when an ac signal is imposed through the structure, resonance frequencies exist where strain distributions are even more strongly affected by piezoelectric-coupling contributions depending on the amount of mechanical and electrical losses in the full material system.",

    "abstract": "The Landau theory of phase transition has been successfully applied to solve a number of important problems in the dynamics of martensitic phase transformations in alloys. On the other hand, although a precise mathematical description of the microstructures is known within the framework of Cauchy-Born hypothesis, its discrete version is not well elucidated in the literature, especially for multivariant transformations in three-dimensional samples. A major reason for such a situation lies with computational difficulties connected with quasi-convexity of the associated minimization problem. In this paper we develop a Landau-Ginzburg free energy model for dynamic problems of phase transformations and show a possible link of the developed framework with the continuum description of phase transformations. We demonstrate how the precise description of compatible microstructures in the phase-field model can be used in computational finite element models. The developed framework is sufficiently general to be applied to different types of phase transforming alloys and under general thermo-mechanical loadings. We exemplify the developed technique and its finite element implementation on cubic to tetragonal transformations.",

In the case of the strong formulation of the problem appropriate interface boundary conditions are derived. In addition, a second-order approximation with respect to a known strain tensor is derived. As a model example, energies for a one-dimensional Kronig-Penney potential are calculated with an exact, a first-order and a second-order strain Hamiltonian. Also, the more realistic example of a rectangular quantum dot is studied. In this example the strain tensor is found using linear isotropic strain theory and the resulting strain tensor is used to study the influence of including first- and second-order strain contributions in electronic band-structure calculations.",

In particular, we present numerical results for a GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor heterostructure nanowire obtained by a 2D numerical simulation based on a transient quantum drift-diffusion model. The model itself is based on the density-gradient theory proposed by Ancona et al. Due to considering angular-symmetric solutions only, two cylindrical coordinates (r and z) suffice for the investigation. Two different numerical implementations of the model employing the finite difference method and finite element method have been used. Influence of the metal contact size on the carrier dynamics and transport inside the nanowire has been investigated. Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics for the same heterostructure nanowire supplemented with different combinations of the metal contacts of different sizes are presented and discussed. It has been demonstrated that the size of the metal contacts strongly influences the carrier dynamics and I-V characteristics of the heterostructure nanowire and that it is possible to produce and tune N-shape of the I-V characteristics by changing the size of the metal contacts. This is of interest in relation to optimization of I-V characteristics of resonant tunneling nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "Ultrashort pulsed lasers have been attracting worldwide interest in science and engineering because the lasers with pulse durations of order of sub-picoseconds to femtoseconds possess exclusive capabilities in limiting the undesirable spread of the thermal process zone in the heated sample. It is important to study the thermal deformation induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers to prevent thermal damage. In this article, we apply a staggered finite difference method to study thermal deformation in a two-dimensional double-layered metal film exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers. The method is obtained based on the parabolic two-step heat transport equations. It accounts for the coupling effect between lattice temperature and strain rate, as well as for the hot-electron blast effect in momentum transfer. The developed methodology allows us to avoid non-physical oscillations in the solution as demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "The first passage time (FPT) problem is ubiquitous in many applications. In finance, we often have to deal with stochastic processes with jump-diffusion, so that the FTP problem is reducible to a stochastic differential equation with jump-diffusion. While the application of the conventional Monte-Carlo procedure is possible for the solution of the resulting model, it becomes computationally inefficient which severely restricts its applicability in many practically interesting cases. In this contribution, we focus on the development of efficient Monte-Carlo-based computational procedures for solving the FPT problem under the multivariate (and correlated) jump-diffusion processes. We also discuss the implementation of the developed Monte-Carlo-based technique for multivariate jump-diffusion processes driving by several compound Poisson shocks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the developed methodologies for analyzing the default rates and default correlations of differently rated firms via historical data. ",

The dumbbell model is a simple but efficient way to describe the behavior of polymers in solutions. In this paper, the dumbbell model with internal viscosity (IV) for concentrated polymeric liquids is analyzed for the steady-state and time-dependent elongational flow and steady-state shear flow. In the elongational flow case, by analyzing the governing ordinary differential equations the contribution of the IV to the stress tensor is discussed for fluids subjected to a sudden elongational jerk. In the shear flow case, the governing stochastic differential equation of the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic dumbbell model is solved numerically. For this case, the extensions of DNA molecules for different shear rates are analyzed, and the comparison with the experimental data is carried out to estimate the contribution of the effect of internal viscosity.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the conventional application of linear models to the analysis of optoelectromechanical properties of nanostructures in bandstructure engineering could be inadequate. Such linear models are usually derived from the traditional bottom-up approach applied to the analysis of nanostructure properties. At the same time, in the hierarchy of mathematical models for semiconductor device modelling constructed on the basis of the top-down approach, we deal predominantly with models where nonlinearity is essential. In this contribution, we analyze these two fundamental approaches in bridging the scales in mathematical models for the description of optoelectromechanical properties of nanostructures. The focus of the present paper is on a model based on the coupled Schrodinger-Poisson system where we account. consistently for the piezoelectric effect and analyze the influence of different nonlinear terms in strain components. The examples given in this paper show that the piezoelectric effect contributions are essential and have to be accounted for with fully coupled models. While in structural applications of piezoelectric materials at larger scales, the minimization of the full electromechanical energy is now a routine in many engineering applications, in bandstructure engineering conventional approaches are still based on linear models with minimization of uncoupled, purely elastic energy functionals with respect to displacements. Generalizations of the existing models for bandstructure calculations are presented in this paper in the context of coupled effects.",

Numerical experiments are performed. Wave propagations caused by impact loadings are analyzed for different initial temperatures. It is demonstrated that thermal waves will be induced.

Despite high output, the current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the device current history are reported.",

The simulated maximal lattices sizes are also increased from L = 384 to L=512.

The data reveal some unexpected small oscillations. It makes the estimation by many-parameter fits of the magnetisation data unstable, and we are looking for an alternative method. Our best estimate p = 0.555(17) is extracted from the analysis of effective exponents determined from local fits of the susceptibility data. This method gives stable and consistent results for both values of, taking into account the leading as well as the subleading correction to scaling.

CNTs grown/deposited in a thin film are used as cathodes for field emission. In spite of the good performance of such cathodes, the procedure to estimate the device current is not straightforward and the required insight towards design optimization is not well developed. In this paper, we report an analysis aided by a computational model and experiments by which the process of evolution and self-assembly (reorientation) of CNTs is characterized and the device current is estimated. The modeling approach involves two steps: (i) a phenomenological description of the degradation and fragmentation of CNTs and (ii) a mechanics based modeling of electromechanical interaction among CNTs during field emission. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in a time incremental manner. Finally, the device current is obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission and by integrating the current density over computational cells. A detailed analysis of the results reveals the deflected shapes of the CNTs in an ensemble and the extent to which the initial state of geometry and orientation angles affect the device current. Experimental results confirm these effects.",

The mathematical model is based on the Landau theory of phase transformations. Each stable phase is associated with a local minimum of the free energy function, and the phase combinations are simulated by minimizing the bulk energy. At low temperature, the free energy function has double potential wells leading to non-convexity of the optimization problem. The methodology proposed in the present paper is based on an initial estimate of the global solution by a genetic algorithm, followed by a refined quasi-Newton procedure to locally refine the optimum. By combining the local and global search algorithms, the phase combinations are successfully simulated.

    "abstract": "Ultrashort pulsed lasers have been attracting worldwide interest in science and engineering communities. Studying the thermal deformation induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers is important for preventing thermal damage. This article presents a new numerical method for studying thermal deformation in a 3D thin film exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers. The method is obtained based on the parabolic two-step model and implicit finite difference schemes on a staggered mesh. It accounts for the coupling effect between lattice temperature and strain rate, as well as for the hot electron-blast effect in momentum transfer. In particular, a fourth-order compact scheme is developed for evaluating those stress derivatives in the dynamic equations of motion. The method allows us to avoid non-physical oscillations in the solution. Its performance is demonstrated by a numerical example.",

In this paper, we investigate several related effects, such as the relationship between the electron-phonon transport and the mechanical deformation in the CNTs. A systematically coupled model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin film is developed. Numerical simulations are reported, which are able to reproduce several experimentally observed phenomena, such as a fluctuating field emission current, deflected CNT tips and the heating process. Examples are shown, where the electrodynamic stretching of the initially deflected CNTs can produce transients in the collective field emission current as large as 10 3 times the usual field emission current. Correspondingly, the tip temperature rises from 303 to 520 K within a time interval of 40 s. A 10 K variability in the maximum temperature is observed over the 0.0144-0.0202 V/nm range of the DC bias electric field. The maximum tensile stress is found to be 1.2 GPa, which is much smaller than the fracture stress.",

Mathematically, such a problem can be reduced to estimating the probability of a stochastic process first to reach a boundary level. In most important applications in the financial industry, the FPT problem does not have an analytical solution and the development of efficient numerical methods becomes the only practical avenue for its solution. Most of our examples in this contribution are centered around the evaluation of default correlations in credit risk analysis, where we are concerned with the joint defaults of several correlated firms, the task that is reducible to a FPT problem. This task represents a great challenge for jump-diffusion processes (JDP). In this contribution, we develop further our previous fast Monte Carlo method in the case of multivariate (and correlated) JDP. This generalization allows us, among other things, to evaluate the default events of several correlated assets based on a set of empirical data. The developed technique is an efficient tool for a number of financial, economic, and business applications, such as credit analysis, barrier option pricing, macroeconomic dynamics, and the evaluation of risk, as well as for a number of other areas of applications in science and engineering, where the FPT problem arises.",

    "abstract": "It is known that with the increasing complexity of technological systems that operate in dynamically changing environments and require human supervision or a human operator, the relative share of human errors is increasing across all modern applications. This indicates that in the analysis and control of such systems, human factors should not be eliminated by conventional formal mathematical methodologies. Instead, they must be incorporated into the modelling framework. In this paper we analyse mathematically how such factors can be effectively incorporated into the analysis and control of complex systems. As an example, we focus our discussion around one of the key problems in the intelligent transportation systems (M) theory and practice, the problem of speed control, considered here as a decision making with limited information available. The problem is cast mathematically in the general framework of control problems and is treated in the context of dynamically changing environments where control is coupled to human factors. Since in this case control might not be limited to a small number of control settings, as it is often assumed in the control literature, serious difficulties arise in the solution of this problem. We demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a set of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations where human factors are incorporated via estimations of the system Hamiltonian. In the ITS context, these estimations can be obtained with the use of on-board equipment like sensors/receivers/actuators, in-vehicle communication devices, etc. The proposed methodology provides a way to integrate human factors into the solving process of the models for other complex dynamic systems.

In the study of cell cycles, nonlinear phenomena play a paramount role, in particular in those cases where the cellular dynamics is in the focus of attention. Quantification of this dynamics is a challenging task due to a wide range of parameters that require estimations and the presence of many stochastic effects. Based on the originally deterministic model, in this paper we develop a hierarchy of models that allow us to describe the nonlinear dynamics accounting for special events of cell cycles. First, we develop a model that takes into account fluctuations of relative concentrations of proteins during special events of cell cycles. Such fluctuations are induced by varying rates of relative concentrations of proteins and/or by relative concentrations of proteins themselves. As such fluctuations may be responsible for qualitative changes in the cell, we develop a new model that accounts for the effect of cellular dynamics on the cell cycle. Finally, we analyze numerically nonlinear effects in the cell cycle by constructing phase portraits based on the newly developed model and carry out a parametric sensitivity analysis in order to identify parameters for an efficient cell cycle control. The results of computational experiments demonstrate that the metabolic events in gene regulatory networks can qualitatively influence the dynamics of the cell cycle.",

This problem arises due to deformation of the CNTs due to electrodynamic force field and electron-phonon interaction. It is of great importance to have precise control of emitted electron beams very near the CNT tips. In this paper, a new array configuration with stacked array of CNTs is analysed and it is shown that the current density distribution is greatly localised at the middle of the array, that the scatter due to electrodynamic force field is minimised and that the temperature transients are much smaller compared to those in an array with random height distribution.",

Hysteretic dynamic behavior of the materials is analyzed as a consequence of orientation switching and the governing equations of the dynamics are formulated as coupled differential equations describing system states switching from one equilibrium state to another. The rate dependence of hysteresis is included in the analysis. A nonlinear feedback strategy is introduced for the linearization and a simple and efficient control strategy is proposed.

The theory results in a system of coupled eigenvalue PDEs that is usually supplemented by interface boundary conditions that can be derived from a variational formulation of the problem. We analyze such a system for the envelope functions and show that a failure to restrict their Fourier expansion coefficients to small k components would lead to the appearance of non-physical solutions. We survey the existing methodologies to eliminate this difficulty and propose a simple and effective solution. This solution is demonstrated on an example of a two-band model for both bulk materials and low-dimensional nanostructures. Finally, based on the above requirement of small k, we derive a model for nanostructures with cylindrical symmetry and apply the developed model to the analysis of quantum dots using an eight-band model.",

According to the computational single crystal elastic constants, all the Al\u2013Ni intermetallic compounds considered here are mechanically stable.

Next, as representatives of group II-VI NW systems we take zincblende CdTe/ZnTe and wurtzite CdSe/CdS crystal structured materials. The detailed analysis of strain relaxation along with electromechanical distributions are presented for common cross-sectional shapes of NWs such as triangular, square and crescent. Comparative results for both models, analytic and numerical, are presented and their applicability is discussed.

The process of evaporation of the ions from the ring upon temperature drop has been found, demonstrating a surprising feature-the uptake of ions by the nanoring increases with the temperature. The connection of this behavior to the dielectric constant of water, hydration and structural changes in the nanoring is discussed. Several properties of the nanoring, such as elastic and transport coefficients, have been determined. A measure of the tensile elasticity of the ring against its uniform 2D in-plane compression has been given, as K(eff) < or = 0.01 GPa, which is a much lower value compared to typical values found for soft matter other than RNA.",

These nanostructures find applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices where they may face challenges for thermal management. Low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum dots (QD) and nanowires, are the nanostructures where such challenges must be particularly carefully addressed. In this contribution we report a study on thermoelectromechanical effects in QDs. For the first time a coupled model of thermoelectroelasticity has been applied to the analysis of quantum dots and the influence of thermoelectromechanical effects on bandstructures of low dimensional nanostructures has been quantified. Finite element solutions are obtained for different thermal loadings and their effects on the electromechanical properties and bandstructure of QDs are presented. Our model accounts for a practically important range of internal and external thermoelectromechanical loadings. Results are obtained for typical QD systems based on GaN/AlN and CdSe/CdS (as representatives of III-V and II-VI group semiconductors, respectively), with cylindrical and truncated conical geometries. The wetting layer effect on electromechanical quantities is also accounted for. The energy bandstructure calculations for various thermal loadings are performed. Electromechanical fields are observed to be more sensitive to thermal loadings in GaN/AlN QDs as compared to CdSe/CdS QDs. The results are discussed in the context of the effect of thermal loadings on the performance of QD-based nanosystems.",

The Chebyshev collocation method is employed for the numerical analysis of the PDE model. An extended proper orthogonal decomposition is then carried out to construct a set of empirical orthogonal eigenmodes of the dynamics, with which system characteristics can be optimally approximated (in a specified sense) within a range of different temperatures and under various mechanical and thermal loadings. The performance of the low dimensional model is analyzed numerically.

For the lattice with linear size L=1024, we have reached the speedup about 1.79 times on two processors and about 2.67 times on four processors, as compared to the serial code. According to our estimation, the speedup about three times on four processors is reachable for the O(n) models with n >= 2. Furthermore, the application of the developed OpenMP code allows us to simulate larger lattices due to greater operative (shared) memory available.",

    "abstract": "A series of coarse-grained models have been developed for study of the molecular dynamics of RNA nanostructures. The models in the series have one to three beads per nucleotide and include different amounts of detailed structural information. Such a treatment allows us to reach, for systems of thousands of nucleotides, a time scale of microseconds (i.e. by three orders of magnitude longer than in full atomistic modeling) and thus to enable simulations of large RNA polymers in the context of bionanotechnology. We find that the three-beads-per-nucleotide models, described by a set of just a few universal parameters, are able to describe different RNA conformations and are comparable in structural precision to the models where detailed values of the backbone P-C4' dihedrals taken from a reference structure are included. These findings are discussed in the context of RNA conformation classes. ",

    "abstract": "In a series of recent papers we demonstrated that coupled electro-mechanical effects can lead to pronounced contributions in band structure calculations of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures (LDSNs) such as quantum dots, wires, and even wells. Some such effects are essentially nonlinear. Both strain and piezoelectric effects have been used as tuning parameters for the optical response of LDSNs in photonics, band gap engineering and other applications. However, the influence of spin orbit effects in presence of external magnetic field on single and vertically coupled Quantum Dots (QDs) has been largely neglected in the literature. The electron spin splitting terms which are coupled to the magnetic field through the Pauli spin matrix in these QDs become important in the design of optoelectronic devices as well as in tayloring properties of QDs in other applications areas. At the same time, single and vertically stacked QDs are coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical fields which become increasingly important in many applications of LDSN-based systems, in particular where spin splitting energy is important. These externally applied electric and magnetic fields as well as the separation between the vertically coupled quantum dots can be used as tuning parameters. Indeed, as electromagnetic and elastic effects are often significant in LDSNs, it is reasonable to expect that the externally applied magnetic fields oriented along a direction perpendicular to the plane of $2$ Dimensional Electron Gas ($2$DEG) in the QDs may also be used as a tuning parameter in the application of light emitting diodes, logic devices, for example, OR gates, AND gates and others. In this paper, by using the fully coupled model of electroelasticity, we analyze the influence of these effects on optoelectronic properties of QDs. Results are reported for III-V type semiconductors with a major focus given to AlN/GaN based QD systems.",

In this paper we present analytical expressions and numerical simulations for the spin-flip probabilities during the adiabatic evolution in the presence of the Rashba and Dresselhaus linear spin-orbit interactions. We use the Feynman disentanglement technique to determine the non-Abelian Berry phase and we find exact analytical expressions for three special cases: (i) the pure Rashba spin-orbit coupling, (ii) the pure Dresselhause linear spin-orbit coupling, and (iii) the mixture of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings with equal strength. For a mixture of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings with unequal strengths, we obtain simulation results by solving numerically the Riccati equation originating from the disentangling procedure. We find that the spin-flip probability in the presence of the mixed spin-orbit couplings is generally larger than those for the pure Rashba case and for the pure Dresselhaus case, and that the complete spin-flip takes place only when the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings are mixed symmetrically.",

The generalized model that accounts for five independent electrostriction coefficients has been solved numerically via a finite-element implementation. The results, exemplified for truncated conical GaN/AlN quantum dots, demonstrate that the effect of nonlinear electrostriction in GaN/AlN nanoheterostructure quantum dots could be significant.

Starting with Goldstone mode singularities in the XY and O(4) models, we briefly review various theoretical concepts, as well as state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulation results. They support recent results of the GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) theory, stating that these singularities are described by certain nontrivial exponents, which differ from those predicted earlier by perturbative treatments. Furthermore, we present the recent Monte Carlo simulation results of the three-dimensional Ising model for lattices with linear sizes up to L = 1536, which are very large as compared to L \u2264 128 usually used in the finite-size scaling analysis. These results are obtained, using a parallel OpenMP implementation of the Wolff single-cluster algorithm. The finite-size scaling analysis of the critical exponent \u03b7, assuming the usually accepted correction-to-scaling exponent \u03c9 \u2248 0:8, shows that \u03b7 is likely to be somewhat larger than the value 0.0335 \u00b1 0.0025 of the perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory. Moreover, we have found that the actual data can be well described by different critical exponents: \u03b7 = \u03c9 = 1/8 and \u03bd = 2/3, found within the GFD theory.",

The excitations are expressed in terms of the wake field of a charged particle moving in plasma. The result explicitly addresses the efficiency of the photon-to-plasmon conversion and the type of excitation. While strong absorption of the radiation by the excitations is reached at larger plasmon wave numbers, intense persistent plasma waves are created at optimal ones. The latter wave numbers depend on the spectrum of plasmons and the distance that the waves are required to travel without being substantially attenuated. Their type, which can be traveling or standing, is governed by the geometry of the defects and the polarization of the radiation. We identify such types of traveling plasmons as circular plasmons, excited at dot defects, and traverse plasmons, excited at straight wire defects and traveling away from (toward) the wires if their group velocity is positive (negative). Nonlinear excitations are also accounted for. In particular, we analyze the zeroth harmonic, linear in the microwave intensity, which has the character of a frozen charge density wave. The interference of elementary wakes from defects arranged in truncated periodic sets can produce amplified plasmons, which are easily portrayed.",

In this paper, we present analytical expressions and numerical simulations of the variation in the Lande g factor for both isotropic and anisotropic quantum dots. Using both analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling has a major contribution in the variation of the g factor with electric fields before the regime, where level crossing or anticrossing occurs. In particular, the electric-field tunability is shown to cover a wide range of g factor through strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Another major result of this paper is that the anisotropic gate potential gives quenching effect in the orbital angular momentum that reduces the variation in the E-field and B-field tunability of the g factor if the area of the symmetric and asymmetric quantum dots is held constant. We identify level crossings and anticrossings of the electron states in the variation of the Lande g factor. We model the wave functions of electron spins and estimate the size of the anticrossing for the spin states vertical bar 0, -1, + 1/2 > and vertical bar 0,0, -1/2 > corresponding to a quantum dot that has been recently studied experimentally [Takahashi et al., Phys.

In particular, hydrogen concentration dependent elastic constants and lattice parameters for the H-doped diamond have been analyzed.

When the hydrogen concentration is about 4 at.%, the optimized lattice parameter, simulated XRD pattern and electronic properties for the H-doped diamond are all agree well with the corresponding experimental values of n-diamond.

Therefore, with this new theory, anisotropic thermal expansion and temperature dependent elastic constants can be obtained for crystals with arbitrary symmetry.

This has required a full solution to the coupled Schr \u0308odinger-Poisson-Navier model, as a generalization of earlier work on the Schr \u0308odinger-Poisson problem. Finite-element-based simulations have been performed on a AlN/GaN quantum well by using both one-step calculation as well as the self-consistent iterative scheme. Results have been provided for field distributions corresponding to cases with zero-displacement boundary conditions and also stress-free boundary conditions. It has been further demonstrated by using four case study examples that a complete self-consistent coupling of electromechanical fields is essential to accurately capture the electromechanical fields and electronic wavefunctions. We have demonstrated that electronic energies can change up to approximately 0.5 eV when comparing partial and complete coupling of electromechanical fields. Similarly, wavefunctions are significantly altered when following a self-consistent procedure as opposed to the partial coupling case usually considered in literature. Hence, a complete self-consistent procedure is necessary when addressing problems requiring more accurate results on optoelectronic properties of low dimensional nanostructures compared to those obtainable with conventional methodologies.",

In the range of 10(4)-10(6) V/cm, the electric field tunability of the phonon induced spin-flip rate can be manipulated through strong Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. These results might assist the development of a spin based solid state quantum computer by manipulating spin-flip rate through spin-orbit coupling in a regime where the g-factor changes its sign. ",

The nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical properties in SMAs have been extensively studied in the bulk case. However at the nanoscale the thermal physics has been usually neglected in a study of SMA properties, and most of the model developments have been carried out under the assumption of isothermal phase transformations. The main aim of this paper is to develop a model that couples the thermal physics and the mechanical dynamics to study the influence of such coupling on the mechanical properties of SMA nanostructures. The developed model is solved using the finite element method. Analyzing FePd alloy nanowires, we observe a steeper slope of the stress\u2013strain curve in the coupled thermo-mechanical case due to temperature evolution during the loading\u2013unloading cycle of such nanostructures. We also observe the martensitic suppression phenomenon in constrained nanowires and nanograins on cooling. We have developed a semi-analytical model to predict a critical size at the onset of martensitic suppression. The semi-analytical model predicts a critical size which is in a good agreement with the numerical results for FePd nanograins. ",

    "abstract": "Shape memory alloy (SMA) is one of the novel advanced functional materials that has an increasing range of current and potential applications, including smart materials and structures, bio-medical and nanotechnologies. This range includes also applications of SMA for control and vibration tuning of various structures, seismic response mitigation, and others. In vibration tuning in many of these applications, it is often necessary to apply supplementary oscillators to absorb the vibration energy input into the primary system. Moreover, when supplementary oscillators are used in these applications, we often have to deal with a situation where the primary vibration frequency is not known a priori. In such cases, we have to design a robust supplementary oscillator such that it is able to operate in a rather wide range of frequencies. A SMA-based oscillator is an ideal candidate for these purposes. In the present paper, we propose a dynamic nonlinear model and its numerical realization for using SMA oscillators as vibration absorbers. The system under consideration consists of a SMA rod and an end-mass. We demonstrate that due to the thermo-mechanical coupling, the vibration characteristics of the supplementary oscillator can be tuned by changing its temperature. The dynamic nonlinear model of the SMA oscillator is simplified for the vibration analysis and an efficient numerical methodology is proposed to evaluate the performance of the oscillator. It is demonstrated that the vibration of the primary system can be tuned within a rather wide frequency range by using the SMA oscillator. It is also shown that at high temperatures the performance of the oscillator is close to that of a linear oscillator, while at low temperatures, the SMA oscillator behaves as a regular damper by using its dissipation due to mechanically-induced phase transformations.",

Based on a strain dependent fully coupled 8-band  method, we computed eigenvalues and wavefunctions of electrons in quantum dots with WLs of different aspect ratios. These computed eigenvalues are compared to those obtained from the method based on decoupled 2-conduction and 6-valence bands envelope functions. Previously, such comparisons, accounting for the wetting layer, were systematically done only for models based on not more than 4-bands. In addition, we apply gate potential along z-direction to bring the conduction and valence bands closer so that we numerically estimate the influence of gate controlled electric fields on the intra-subband energy in quantum dots. Due to the non-parabolicity term in the effective mass approximation, our study shows that the intra-sub band energy (i.e., the energy difference between ground and first excited states) is smaller for electrons and larger for holes in the 8-band  method than those eigenvalues obtained from the decoupled 2-conduction and 6-valence bands envelope functions method. In this paper, we show that the intra-sub band energy increases in presence of piezo-electromechanical effects and externally applied gate potentials along z-direction. We numerically estimate the distribution (i.e., the probability density) of electrons and holes wavefunctions in the dots that is obtained from both the 8-band  method and the decoupled 2- and 6-bands envelope functions method.",

A recent MC estimation of \u03bb||, assuming corrections to scaling of the standard theory, yields \u03bb|| = 0.69 \u00b1 0.10 for the O(2) model. Currently, we have performed a similar MC estimation for the O(10) model, yielding \u03bb\u22a5 = 1.9723(90). We have observed that the plot of the effective transverse exponent for the O(4) model is systematically shifted down with respect to the same plot for the O(10) model by \u0394 \u03bb\u22a5 = 0.0121(52). It is consistent with the idea that 2-\u03bb\u22a5 decreases for large n and tends to zero at n \u2192 \u221e. We have also verified and confirmed the expected universality of b M2/a2 for the O(4) model, where simulations at two different temperatures (couplings) have been performed.",

    "abstract": "Many problems in science, engineering, and finance require the information on the first passage time (FPT) of a stochastic process. Mathematically, such problems are often reduced to the evaluation of the probability density of the time for such a process to cross a certain level, a boundary, or to enter a certain region. While in other areas of applications the FPT problem can often be solved analytically, in finance we usually have to resort to the application of numerical procedures, in particular when we deal with jump-diffusion stochastic processes (JDP). In this paper, we propose a Monte-Carlo-based methodology for the solution of the FPT problem in the context of multivariate (and correlated) JDPs. The developed technique provides an efficient tool for a number of applications, including credit risk and option pricing. We demonstrate its applicability to the analysis of default rates and default correlations of several different, but correlated firms via a set of empirical data.\n\n",

These thermodynamic models are non-isothermal and allow to account for the thermo-mechanical material properties of both austenite and martensite phases based on the local phase value of the order parameter. They are based on the Ginzburg\u2013Landau free energy and the phase field theory. The core of the models is a phase evolution governed by the time dependent Ginzburg\u2013Landau (TDGL) equation and the conservation balance laws with nonlinear coupling between stress, strain and the phase order parameter. The models account for the gradient energy and have been tested in the study of material properties evolution under harmonic stress loading for all important practical cases. The representative numerical simulations have been carried out here without the gradient energy term. The developed models account for the phase dependent properties based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order parameter and stress. We also compared the results obtained with these models and observed differences in homogeneous and inhomogeneous situations due to the change in compliance. In this way, the description of quasiplastic and pseudoelastic behaviors in SMA specimens is improved and becomes in an agreement with existing experiments.",

We demonstrate that the influence of such coupled effects in the general fully coupled framework for studying properties of QDs can be significant and we quantify these effects in each case. For example, in magnetic GaN/BaTiO3 QDs, we found that the influence of electromechanical effects on the band structure calculations and the spin splitting energy are practically independent of temperature. However, in piezoelectric AlN/GaN QDs, the influence of temperature on the electromechanical effects, electronic properties and spin splitting energy is significant. In particular, in piezoelectric AlN/GaN QDs, the intra-subband energy (i.e., the energy difference between ground and first excited states) decreases with the increase in temperature.",

This system for superlattice transport is supplemented by the quantum mechanical part of the model based on the Ben-Daniel\u2013Duke form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a cylindrical superlattice of finite radius. The resulting energy spectrum is used to characterize the Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution that appears in the Bhatnagar\u2013Gross\u2013Krook collision, thereby coupling the quantum mechanical and kinetic parts of the model. The kinetic model uses the dispersion relation obtained by the generalized Kronig\u2013Penney method, and allows us to estimate radii of quantum wire superlattices that have the same miniband widths as in experiments. It also allows us to determine more accurately the time-dependent characteristics of superlattices, in particular their current density. Results, for several experimentally grown superlattices, are discussed in the context of self-sustained coherent oscillations of the current density which are important in an increasing range of current and potential applications.",

The coupled piezo-electromechanical model for semiconductor materials takes into account the strain, piezoelectric effects, and spontaneous polarization. Based on the developed 3D model, the band structures of electrons (holes) obtained from results of modeling in Cartesian coordinates are in good agreement with those values obtained from our earlier developed 2D model in cylindrical coordinates. Several parameters such as lattice mismatch, piezo-electric fields, valence, and conduction band offsets at the heterojunction of AlxGa1\u2013xN/GaN superlattice can be varied as a function of the Al mole fraction. When the band offsets at the heterojunction of AlxGa1\u2013xN/GaN are very small and the influence of the piezo-electromechanical effects can be minimized, then the barrier material can no longer be treated as an infinite potential well. In this situation, it is possible to visualize the penetration of the Bloch wave function into the barrier material that provides an estimation of critical radii of NWSLs. In this case, the NWSLs can act as inversion layers. Finally, we investigate the influence of symmetry of the square and cylindrical NWSLs on the band structures of electrons in the conduction band.",

    "abstract": "In symmetric quantum dots (QDs), it is well known that the spin hot spot (i.e., the cusplike structure due to the presence of degeneracy near the level or anticrossing point) is present for the pure Rashba case but is absent for the pure Dresselhaus case [Bulaev and Loss, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 076805 (2005)]. Since the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling dominates over the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in GaAs and GaSb QDs, it is important to find the exact location of the spin hot spot or the cusplike structure even for the pure Dresselhaus case. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical results that show that the spin hot spot can also be seen for the pure Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling case by inducing large anisotropy through external gates. At or nearby the spin hot spot, the spin transition rate increases and the decoherence time decreases by several orders of magnitude compared to the case with no spin hot spot. Thus one should avoid such locations when designing QD spin based transistors for possible implementation in quantum logic gates, solid-state quantum computing, and quantum information processing. It is also possible to extract the exact experimental data [Amasha, MacLean, Radu, Zumb\u00fchl, Kastner, Hanson, and Gossard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 046803 (2008] for the phonon mediated spin-flip rates from our developed theoretical model.",

The pressure\u2013temperature phase diagram and the phase transformation pathways of CdS have been investigated by using density functional theory combined with quasiharmonic approximation. Our results indicated that under ambient conditions, wz-CdS is a stable phase, while under high temperature and pressure, rs-CdS becomes the stable phase. It is also found that zb-CdS is an intermediate phase in transforming from rs-CdS to wz-CdS. Therefore, although there are no zb-CdS phase regions in the CdS pressure\u2013temperature phase diagram, zb-CdS can be found in some prepared experiments.",

    "abstract": "\nCorrelation functions in the (n) models below the critical temperature are considered. Based on Monte Carlo (MC) data, we confirm the fact stated earlier by Engels and Vogt, that the transverse two-plane correlation function of the (4) model for lattice sizes about L = 120 and small external fields h is very well described by a Gaussian approximation. However, we show that fits of not lower quality are provided by certain non-Gaussian approximation. We have also tested larger lattice sizes, up to L = 512. The Fourier-transformed transverse and longitudinal two-point correlation functions have Goldstone mode singularities in the thermodynamic limit at k \u2192 0 and h = +0, i.e., G\u22a5 (k) \u2243 ak\u2013\u03bb\u22a5 and G\u2016(k)\u2243bk\u2013\u03bb\u2016, respectively. Here a and b are the amplitudes, k = |k| is the magnitude of the wave vector k. The exponents \u03bb\u1686, \u03bb\u2016 and the ratio bM2/a2, where M is the spontaneous magnetization, are universal according to the GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) approach. Here we find that the universality follows also from the standard (Gaussian) theory, yielding bM2/a2=(n\u22121)/16. Our MC estimates of this ratio are 0.06\u00b10.01 for n=2, 0.17\u00b10.01 for n = 4 and 0.498\u00b10.010 for n = 10. According to these and our earlier MC results, the asymptotic behavior and Goldstone mode singularities are not exactly described by the standard theory. This is expected from the GFD theory. We have found appropriate analytic approximations for G\u22a5(k) and G\u2016(k), well fitting the simulation data for small k. We have used them to test the Patashinski-Pokrovski relation and have found that it holds approximately.",

The phase-field model with Ginzburg\u2013Landau energy, having appropriate strain based order parameter and strain gradient energy contributions, is used to study the martensitic transformations in the representative 2D square-to-rectangular phase transformations for FePd SMA nanowires. The microstructure and mechanical behavior of martensitic transformations in SMA nanostructures have been studied extensively in the literature for uniaxial loading, usually under isothermal assumptions. The developed model describes the martensitic transformations in SMAs based on the equations for momentum and energy with bi-directional coupling via strain, strain rate and temperature. These governing equations of the thermo-mechanical model are numerically solved simultaneously for different external loadings starting with the evolved twinned and austenitic phases. We observed a strong influence of multi-axial loading on dynamic thermo-mechanical properties of SMA nanowires. Notably, the multi-axial loadings are quite distinct as compared to the uniaxial loading case, and the particular axial stress level is reached at a lower strain. The SMA behaviors predicted by the model are in qualitative agreements with experimental and numerical results published in the literature. The new results reported here on the nanowire response to multi-axial loadings provide new physical insight into underlying phenomena and are important, for example, in developing better SMA-based MEMS and NEMS devices\n",

In addition, the relative importance between grain boundaries (GBs) and size effects on the ETC of nanocrystalline diamond at 300\u2005K has been studied. It has been demonstrated that with increasing grain size, both GBs and size effects become weaker, while size effects become stronger on thermal conductivity than GBs effects.",

Thermoelectromechanical effects are treated via pseudomorphic vector potentials to analyze the influence of these coupled effects on the band structures of bilayer-graphene quantum dots. We report that the level crossing between the ground and first-excited states in the localized edge states can be achieved with accessible values of temperature. In particular, the level-crossing point extends to higher temperatures with decreasing externally applied tensile edge stress along the armchair direction. This kind of level crossing is absent in the states formed at the center of the graphene sheet due to the presence of threefold symmetry.",

Besides, the water splitting reaction is found to be a thermally activated process, and the first hydrogen atom is easier decomposing from the adsorbed water molecule than the second one for most of the 3C-SiC surfaces. Furthermore, the water molecule that splitting on 3C-SiC (1 1 1) surface requires relatively small activation energy by contrast with other surfaces.

The model is of phase-field type and is based on the Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory. The hysteresis and phase transformations are governed by the kinetic phase evolution equation using the scalar order parameter, laws of conservation of the momentum and energy and a nonlinear coupling of the stress, the strain and the order parameter in a differential form. One of the important features of the model is that the phase transformation is governed by the stress tensor, as opposed to the transformation strain tensor typically used in the literature. The model takes into account different properties of austenite and martensite phases based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order parameter and stress. Representative numerical simulations on an SMA specimen reproduce hysteretic behaviors observed experimentally in the literature.\n",

The process of knowledge creation requires meaningful, logically coordinated interactions, which represents a challenging problem to physics and social dynamics modeling. By combining two-scale dynamics model with empirical data analysis from a well-known Questions & Answers system Mathematics, we show that this process occurs as a collective phenomenon in an enlarged network (of actors and their artifacts) where the cognitive recognition interactions are properly encoded. The emergent behavior is quantified by the information divergence and innovation advancing of knowledge over time and the signatures of self-organization and knowledge sharing communities. These measures elucidate the impact of each cognitive element and the individual actor\u2019s expertise in the collective dynamics. The results are relevant to stochastic processes involving smart components and to collaborative social endeavors, for instance, crowdsourcing scientific knowledge production with online games.",

    "abstract": "In the current paper, a nonlinear differential algebraic approach is proposed for the modeling of hysteretic dynamics of polycrystalline ferromagnetic materials. The model is constructed by employing a phenomenological theory to the magnetization orientation switching. For the modeling of hysteresis in polycrystalline ferromagnetic materials, the single crystal model is applied to each magnetic domain along its own principal axis. The overall dynamics of the polycrystalline materials is obtained by taking a weighted combination of the dynamics of all magnetic domains. The weight function for the combination is taken as the distribution function of the principal axes. Numerical simulations are performed and comparisons with its experimental counterparts are presented. The hysteretic dynamics caused by orientation switching processes is accurately captured by the proposed model. Minor hysteresis loops associated with partial-amplitude loadings are also captured. Rate dependence of the hysteresis loops are inherently incorporated into the model due to its differential nature.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of a retracting cantilevered beam has been investigated by the invariant and energy-based analysis. The time-varying parameter partial differential equation governing the transverse vibrations of a beam with retracting motion is derived based on the momentum theorem. The assumed-mode method is used to truncate the governing partial differential equation into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with time-dependent coefficients. It is found that if the order of truncation is not less than the order of the initial conditions, the assumed-mode method can yield accurate results. The energy transfers among assumed modes are discussed during retraction. The total energy varying with time has been investigated by numerical and analytical methods, and the results have good agreement with each other. For the transverse vibrations of the axially retracting beam, the adiabatic invariant is derived by both the averaging method and the Bessel function method.",

    "abstract": "The communication processes of knowledge creation represent a particular class of human dynamics where the expertise of individuals plays a substantial role, thus offering a unique possibility to study the structure of knowledge networks from online data. Here, we use the empirical evidence from questions-and-answers in mathematics to analyse the emergence of the network of knowledge contents (or tags) as the individual experts use them in the process. After removing extra edges from the network-associated graph, we apply the methods of algebraic topology of graphs to examine the structure of higher-order combinatorial spaces in networks for four consecutive time intervals. We find that the ranking distributions of the suitably scaled topological dimensions of nodes fall into a unique curve for all time intervals and filtering levels, suggesting a robust architecture of knowledge networks. Moreover, these networks preserve the logical structure of knowledge within emergent communities of nodes, labeled according to a standard mathematical classification scheme. Further, we investigate the appearance of new contents over time and their innovative combinations, which expand the knowledge network. In each network, we identify an innovation channel as a subgraph of triangles and larger simplices to which new tags attach. Our results show that the increasing topological complexity of the innovation channels contributes to network\u2019s architecture over different time periods, and is consistent with temporal correlations of the occurrence of new tags. The methodology applies to a wide class of data with the suitable temporal resolution and clearly identified knowledge-content units.",

Analytical arguments show the existence of corrections with the exponent 3\u22154. The numerical analysis suggests that there exist also corrections with the exponent 1\u22152 and, perhaps, also with the exponent about 1\u22154, which are detectable at \u03bb=0.1.

Applied to elemental crystals, the correlation between atomic cluster radii and the ECP that we have predicted agrees well with the previously reported results. In addition, some other physicochemical properties associated with the ECP have also been found relevant to the atomic cluster radii of materials. Thus, the atomic cluster radii can be perceived as an effective characteristic parameter to measure the ECP and related properties of materials. Our results provide a better understanding of ECP directly from the atomic structures perspective.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of shape memory alloy (SMA) nanostructures is influenced by strain rate and temperature evolution during dynamic loading. The coupling between temperature, strain, and strain rate is essential to capture inherent thermomechanical behavior in SMAs. In this paper, we propose a new 3D phase-field model that accounts for two-way coupling between mechanical and thermal physics. We use the strain-based Ginzburg-Landau potential for cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformations. The variational formulation of the developed model is implemented in the isogeometric analysis framework to overcome numerical challenges. We have observed a complete disappearance of the out-of-plane martensitic variant in a very high aspect ratio SMA domain as well as the presence of three variants in equal portions in a low aspect ratio SMA domain. The dependence of different boundary conditions on the microstructure morphology has been examined energetically. The tensile tests on rectangular prism nanowires, using the displacement based loading, demonstrate the shape memory effect and pseudoelastic behavior. We have also observed that higher strain rates, as well as the lower aspect ratio domains, resulting in high yield stress and phase transformations occur at higher stress during dynamic axial loading.",

Due to the cubic symmetry, the Fermi surface of sc-C96 is constituted of three nodal line circles.

We argue that the Zeeman pseudospin (p-spin) splitting energy induced by ripple waves might not be neglected for smaller widths of armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We show that the p-spin splitting energy breaks the symmetry of degeneracy due to the ripple-induced Zeeman effect in GNRs, originating from electromechanical coupling. We estimate the p-spin lifetime in strained armchair GNRs caused by in-plane phonon modes for possible applications in straintronics and quantum information processing. By considering higher order terms in the strain tensor expansion, we also demonstrate that highly asymmetric band structures of GNRs induce asymmetric phonon-mediated p-spin relaxation. Such asymmetric p-spin relaxation is not possible for unstrained armchair and zigzag GNRs. In particular, we report that the p-spin transition rate decreases like B 5 0 (as a function of p-magnetic fields), L \u2212 9 (as a function of GNR width) and \u03c4 \u22121e, where \u03c4e is the externally applied tensile edge stress.",

Analytical arguments show the existence of corrections with the exponent (\u03b3\u22121)\u2215\u03bd\u22480.38, the leading correction-to-scaling exponent being \u03c9\u2264(\u03b3\u22121)\u2215\u03bd. A numerical estimation of \u03c9 from the susceptibility data within 40\u2264L\u22642560 yields \u03c9=0.21(29), in agreement with this statement. We reconsider the MC estimation of \u03c9 from smaller lattice sizes, L\u2264384, using different finite-size scaling methods, and show that these sizes are still too small, since no convergence to the same result is observed. In particular, estimates ranging from \u03c9=0.866(21) to \u03c9=1.247(73) are obtained, using MC data for thermodynamic average quantities, as well as for partition function zeros. However, a trend toward smaller \u03c9 values is observed in one of these cases in a refined estimation from extended data up to L=1536. We discuss the influence of \u03c9 on the estimation of critical exponents \u03b7 and \u03bd.",

Analysis with phonon kinetic theory shows that low thermal conductivity in the Si/Ge hetero-twinned SLs is caused by the combined actions of reduced phonon group velocity and reduced relaxation time. Moreover, despite similar thermal conductivity in Si/Ge hetero-twinned SLs and conventional Si/Ge SLs, the phonon group velocity and relaxation time in the two structures are totally different.

We study the bandgap opening due to strain induced ripple waves and investigate the interplay between pseudomagnetic fields and externally applied magnetic fields on the band structures and spin relaxation in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We show that electron-hole bands of GNRs are highly influenced (i.e. level crossing of the bands are possible) by coupling two combined effects: pseudomagnetic fields (PMF) originating from strain tensor and external magnetic fields. In particular, we show that the tuning of the spin-splitting band extends to large externally applied magnetic fields with increasing values of pseudomagnetic fields. Level crossings of the bands in strained GNRs can also be observed due to the interplay between pseudomagnetic fields and externally applied magnetic fields. We also investigate the influence of this interplay on the electromagnetic field mediated spin relaxation mechanism in GNRs. In particular, we show that the spin hot spot can be observed at approximately B = 65 T (the externally applied magnetic field) and B0 = 53 T (the magnitude of induced pseudomagnetic field due to ripple waves) which may not be considered as an ideal location for the design of straintronic devices. Our analysis might be used for tuning the bandgaps in strained GNRs and utilized to design the optoelectronic devices for straintronic applications.",

    "abstract": "In online social dynamics, a robust scale invariance appears as a key feature of collaborative efforts that lead to new social value. The underlying empirical data thus offers a unique opportunity to study the origin of self-organized criticality (SOC) in social systems. In contrast to physical systems in the laboratory, various human attributes of the actors play an essential role in the process along with the contents (cognitive, emotional) of the communicated artifacts. As a prototypical example, we consider the social endeavor of knowledge creation via Questions and Answers (Q&A). Using a large empirical data set from one of such Q&A sites and theoretical modeling, we reveal fundamental characteristics of SOC by investigating the temporal correlations at all scales and the role of cognitive contents to the avalanches of the knowledge-creation process. Our analysis shows that the universal social dynamics with power-law inhomogeneities of the actions and delay times provides the primary mechanism for self-tuning towards the critical state; it leads to the long-range correlations and the event clustering in response to the external driving by the arrival of new users. In addition, the involved cognitive contents (systematically annotated in the data and observed in the model) exert important constraints that identify unique classes of the knowledge-creation avalanches. Specifically, besides determining a fine structure of the developing knowledge networks, they affect the values of scaling exponents and the geometry of large avalanches and shape the multifractal spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the level of the activity of the communities that share the knowledge correlates with the fluctuations of the innovation rate, implying that the increase of innovation may serve as the active principle of self-organization. To identify relevant parameters and unravel the role of the network evolution underlying the process in the social system under consideration, we compare the social avalanches to the avalanche sequences occurring in the field-driven physical model of disordered solids, where the factors contributing to the collective dynamics are better understood.",

A nanowire-film coupled system consists of a nanowire made of a noble metal such as gold (Au) placed over a film of the same material. Such a system exhibits an optical response that is extremely sensitive to gap between the nanowire and film which makes it favorable for various sensing applications. The nonlocal effect of the plasmonic medium significantly affects the resonant wavelength of the coupled system for structures of small dimensions (less than 10 nm). We present new computational results that can be used to predict the effect of non-locality on the resonances of the system. The results obtained with the model accounting for non-local hydrodynamics response are more accurate and can be applied for ultrafast dynamics in nanoplasmonic system.",

Experimental results suggest that ions present in sea water, also called smart water, have a significant influence on the wettability alteration (less oil wet) of calcite surface. In this paper, by utilizing Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) simulations, we investigate the effect of additive ions of sea water in oil recovery by using acetic acid as a model compound of crude oil molecules. We find that Na+ ions precipitate to the calcite surface and form Na acetate. The binding energy of Na acetate is larger than original oil molecule (acetic acid), which reduces oil recovery. On the other hand, Mg2+ and SO2\u22124 ions can also reach to the calcite surface in proximity and modify the calcite surface. The binding energy of oil molecule on modified calcite surface is smaller than on pure calcite surface, which enhances oil recovery.

In the enhanced crude oil recovery stage, additives, Mg2+ and SO42\u2212 ions of sea water alter the relative wettability characteristics (from oil-wet to less oil-wet) of calcite surface that enhances the crude oil recovery. In this paper, we consider naphthenic acid is a model compound of crude oil molecule, perform Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and checking its relative binding energy (i.e. the binding energy difference between water and oil molecule) is an indication of relative wettability alteration of calcite surface. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Mg2+ ion replaces Ca2+ of calcite and then SO42\u2212 ion replaces CO32\u2212 of calcite. The relative binding energy of oil molecule is larger on modified calcite.MgSO4 surface than on pure calcite surface, providing an indication of less oil wet calcite surface. Ab initio molecular results also show that few Na+ ions of sea water reach to the calcite surface as a precipitate and form Na naphthenates that make oil molecule more sticker (more oil-wet) to the rock surface. Combined study of DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations can help to understand the surface interaction between oil molecule and calcite surface in aqueous sea water environment that has global impact on crude oil recovery from calcite oil reservoirs.",

In both cases, the effects of the bias voltage and bias resistance are carefully investigated and the optimum values are obtained. Later, the energy-harvesting process and energy flow details in both harvesters working at the optimum conditions are presented and carefully compared in the context of real applications. Furthermore, the energy-harvesting performance of a BaTiO3-based nanoscale piezoelectric energy harvester with equivalent material size is additionally simulated with the finite element method and compared with the corresponding results of the ferroelectric energy harvesters, where obvious advantages associated with the new strategy are demonstrated.",

In this paper, homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation nature for diamond 16112 glide set dislocation and 12110 shuffle set dislocation is studied by combining molecular dynamics method and continuum mechanics models. Our results show that although heterogeneous dislocation nucleation can decrease its activation energy, the activation energy at 0\u202fGPa for diamond heterogeneous nucleation is still in the range of 100\u202feV. For 16112 glide set and 12110 shuffle set homogeneous nucleation, their critical nucleation shear stress approaches to diamond's ideal shear strength which implies that those dislocations do not nucleate before diamond structural instability only by a purely shearing manner. While for 16112 glide set and 12110 shuffle set heterogeneous nucleation, their critical nucleation shear stresses are 28.9\u202fGPa and 48.2\u202fGPa, these values are less than diamond's ideal shear strength which implies that these dislocations may be nucleated heterogeneously under certain shear stress condition. In addition, our results also indicate there exists a deformation mode transformation for diamond deformation behavior at strain rate of 10\u22123/s. Our results provide a new insight into diamond dislocation nucleation and deformation.",

We provide an experimentally feasible setup based on the Veselago lens in which the presence of strain can result in both the valley-dependent Lorentz force and Aharonov-Bohm interference. In particular, by employing the Green's function and tight-binding methods, we study the strain induced by dislocations and line defects in a p \u2212 n junction and show how the resulting Aharonov-Bohm phase and interference can be detected.

Graphene and diamond with standard sp2 and sp3 hybridization, respectively, are also examined for comparison. Our results indicate that the thermal conductivities of T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 at room temperature are much lower than those of diamond and graphene. Phonon kinetic theory analysis shows that the lower thermal conductivity of T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 is caused by the combined action of their reduced phonon group velocities and relaxation time. Moreover, the bond difference parameter has been proposed to describe the relationship between bond structures and thermal conductivity in carbon allotropes, which presents a new and convenient method for in-depth understanding the thermal conductivity of carbon allotropes.",

    "abstract": "Piezoelectric composites are a class of smart materials which can be manufactured in a scalable manner by additive processes, while catering to a wide range of applications. Recent efforts are directed towards composites of lead-free piezoelectric materials with a goal of achieving performances comparable to lead-based composites. While there has been extensive research in fabrication methodologies such as 3D printing, which can manufacture complex piezoelectric structures in a scalable manner, there are important remaining questions as to how the performance of lead-free piezoelectric composites can be further improved. Fundamental to this is the understanding of key factors underlying piezoelectric performance: the electro-elastic interactions between the piezoelectric material and the matrix, the effects of the polycrystalline microstructure of the piezoelectric inclusions, the effect of randomly shaped polycrystalline fillers, and the effect of the volume fraction of the piezoelectric material in the matrix. A strong motivation for using polycrystalline fillers is that they can exhibit enhanced piezoelectric and mechanical properties compared to single crystalline materials. Moreover, polycrystalline materials are amenable to scalable manufacturing. We computationally investigate these important aspects of piezoelectric composite design and performance by taking into account for the first time the polycrystalline nature of lead-free piezoelectric inclusions, in the context of a matrix-inclusion composite. We achieve this by dispersing randomly shaped polycrystalline inclusions at random positions in the matrix which allows us to better understand the behavior of practical composite architectures. In such cases, our analysis reveals that although polycrystalline piezoelectric materials, in isolation, can outperform their single crystal counterparts, in a composite architecture these enhancements are not straightforward. We identify the sources of loss which prevent polycrystalline inclusions from enhancing the performance of the composites. By tuning the dielectric environment in the matrix through the inclusion of metallic nanoparticles, we demonstrate how the performance of the composites can be further significantly improved. Specifically, when the metal nanoparticles are near the percolation threshold, we show that polycrystalline piezoelectric inclusions perform better than single crystals, with an improvement of around 14.6% in the effective piezoelectric response. We conclude that such novel architectures, devised by a combination of polycrystalline piezoelectric inclusions in a high permittivity environment, can improve the performance of the composites beyond the single crystal design and thus offer a promising direction for 3D printable lead-free piezoelectric composites.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative self-assembly is a ubiquitous phenomenon found in natural systems which is used for designing nanostructured materials with new functional features. Its origin and mechanisms, leading to improved functionality of the assembly, have attracted much attention from researchers in many branches of science and engineering. These complex structures often come with hyperbolic geometry; however, the relation between the hyperbolicity and their spectral and dynamical properties remains unclear. Using the model of aggregation of simplexes introduced by \u0160uvakov et al. [Sci. Rep. 8, 1987 (2018)], here we study topological and spectral properties of a large class of self-assembled structures or nanonetworks consisting of monodisperse building blocks (cliques of size n=3,4,5,6) which self-assemble via sharing the geometrical shapes of a lower order. The size of the shared substructure is tuned by varying the chemical affinity \u03bd such that for significant positive \u03bd sharing the largest face is the most probable, while for \u03bd<0, attaching via a single node dominates. Our results reveal that, while the parameter of hyperbolicity remains \u03b4max=1 across the assemblies, their structure and spectral dimension ds vary with the size of cliques n and the affinity when \u03bd\u22650. In this range, we find that ds>4 can be reached for n\u22655 and sufficiently large \u03bd. For the aggregates of triangles and tetrahedra, the spectral dimension remains in the range ds\u2208[2,4), as well as for the higher cliques at vanishing affinity. On the other end, for \u03bd<0, we find ds\u22421.57 independently on n. Moreover, the spectral distribution of the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues has a characteristic shape with peaks and a pronounced minimum, representing the hierarchical architecture of the simplicial complexes. These findings show how the structures compatible with complex dynamical properties can be assembled by controlling the higher-order connectivity among the building blocks.",

However, the latent structure on higher-order interactions remains unexplored, where many brain regions act in synergy to perform complex functions. Here we use the simplicial complexes description of human connectome, where the shared simplexes encode higher-order relationships between groups of nodes. We study consensus connectome of 100 female (F-connectome) and of 100 male (M-connectome) subjects that we generated from the Budapest Reference Connectome Server v3.0 based on data from the Human Connectome Project. Our analysis reveals that the functional geometry of the common F&M-connectome coincides with the M-connectome and is characterized by a complex architecture of simplexes to the 14th order, which is built in six anatomical communities, and linked by short cycles. The F-connectome has additional edges that involve different brain regions, thereby increasing the size of simplexes and introducing new cycles. Both connectomes contain characteristic subjacent graphs that make them 3/2-hyperbolic. These results shed new light on the functional architecture of the brain, suggesting that insightful differences among connectomes are hidden in their higher-order connectivity.",

However, lead-free materials lag lead-based piezo-composites in terms of performance, thus necessitating new design strategies to escalate piezoelectric response. Here, we build a modeling paradigm for improving the piezoelectric performance through improved matrices and optimal polycrystallinity in the piezoelectric inclusions. By incorporating carbon nanotubes in the matrix, we demonstrate 2\u20133 orders of improvement in the piezoelectric response, through simultaneous hardening of the matrix and improvement in its permittivity. By tuning the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions, we show considerable improvements exceeding 50% in the piezo-response, compared to single crystal inclusions. We further analyze the influence of carbon nanotube agglomerations at supramolecular length scales, as well as vacancy defects in the nanotubes at the atomic level, on composite performance. Although nanomaterial agglomeration is conventionally considered undesirable, we show that, near nanotube percolation, clustering of nanotubes can lead to better matrix hardening and higher permittivities, leading to improvements exceeding 30% in the piezoelectric response compared to non-agglomerated architectures. We further demonstrate that although atomic vacancy defects in nanotubes effectively soften the matrix, this can be compensated by agglomeration of nanotubes at larger length-scales.",

By illustrated examples of frequency analysis on Timoshenko beam and composite sandwich structure, the substitution method has verified to be valid and efficient.

    "abstract": "Thermal ablation is a widely applied electrosurgical process in medical treatment of soft biological tissues. Numerical modeling and simulations play an important role in prediction of temperature distribution and damage volume during the treatment planning stage of associated therapies. In this contribution we report a coupled thermo-electro-mechanical model, accounting for heat relaxation time, for more accurate and precise prediction of the temperature distribution, tissue deformation and damage volume during the thermal ablation of biological tissues. Finite element solutions are obtained for most widely used percutaneous thermal ablative techniques, viz., radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Importantly, both tissue expansion and shrinkage have been considered for modeling the tissue deformation in the coupled model of high temperature thermal ablation. The coupled model takes into account the non-Fourier effects, considering both single-phase-lag (SPL) and dual-phase-lag (DPL) models of bio-heat transfer. The temperature-dependent electrical and thermal parameters, damage-dependent blood perfusion rate and phase change effect accounting for tissue vaporization have been accounted for obtaining more clinically relevant model. The proposed model predictions are found to be in good agreement against the temperature distribution and damage volume reported by previous experimental studies. The numerical simulation results revealed that the non-Fourier effects cause a decrease in the predicted temperature distribution, tissue deformation and damage volume during the high temperature thermal ablative procedures. Furthermore, the effects of different magnitudes of phase lags of the heat flux and temperature gradient on the predicted treatment outcomes of the considered thermal ablative modalities are also quantified and discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "Lead-free piezoelectric composites with polymeric matrices offer a scalable and eco-friendly solution to sensing and energy harvesting applications. Piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF are particularly interesting because of the possibility to engineer the performance of these materials through addition of higher-performance piezoelectric inclusions and nanomaterials and to scalably manufacture such composites by emerging techniques such as 3D printing. This work makes two contributions, namely towards composite design and towards development of accurate effective property models. In the context of composite design, we evaluate the piezoelectric performance of PVDF modified by the addition of polycrystalline-BaTiO3 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Firstly, the addition of BaTiO3 dramatically improves the electric field within the composite offering significant advantages specially at low BaTiO3 concentrations. Secondly, the addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix, particularly at higher BaTiO3 loadings, leads to an order of magnitude increase in the piezoelectric flux generation. Further enhancement in the flux generation is also possible by tuning the polycrystallinity of the BaTiO3 inclusions. However, these behaviours are inclusion-driven and the piezoelectric behaviour of the matrix does not contribute to this improvement. Importantly, a small addition of BaTiO3 and CNT into the PVDF matrix, away from percolation, can simultaneously improve flux and electric field generation. In this part of the work, we assume an isotropic PVDF matrix. Given that PVDF is elastically anisotropic, the second aspect of this work is the development of an effective property model for CNT-modified PVDF, taking into account the elastic anisotropy of poled PVDF, to predict the elastic coefficients of CNT-modified PVDF matrices, thus undertaking a key step towards modelling anisotropic piezoelectric composites. We show that the anisotropy-based model makes similar predictions in the effective composite behaviour, indicating that in the case of PVDF-based piezocomposites, the anisotropy of the matrix does not significantly affect the piezoresponse.",

Current piezocomposite design heavily relies on the linear piezoelectric model which neglects nonlocal and nonlinear electro-elastic processes. Here we develop a more accurate modelling paradigm to determine the contributions from nonlocal flexoelectric and nonlinear electrostrictive effects towards the performance of lead-free piezocomposites. We find that in the case of microscale randomly shaped piezoelectric inclusions which represent a practical scenario, the flexoelectric effect does not contribute appreciably towards the piezoelectric response. However, the nonlinear electrostrictive effects impart significant strain-dependent responses. Further, in nano-modified composites, we find that the nonlinear electro-mechanical coupling can have different effects on the transverse and the longitudinal electro-elastic responses. In particular, the longitudinal electric field response, with the nonlinear contribution, is less sensitive to the polycrystalline structure of the piezoelectric inclusions. These observations clearly indicate that at larger strains, nonlinear effects cannot be neglected. In general, our results entail that it is important to include nonlocal and nonlinear processes for reliable and accurate modelling of piezocomposites.",

Therefore, in the context of mechanically superior high-performance piezo-composites, graphene-modified composite architectures represent an important design direction. In this paper, we first develop an effective property model for graphene-modified piezoelectric matrices, taking into account the mechanical anisotropy of the matrix. We further evaluate the piezoelectric performance of the matrix architecture which incorporates lead-free BaTiO3 polycrystal inclusions. In order to obtain comparisons with well-established composites, we compare the electro-elastic response of two composite architectures in which the matrix is modified by multiwalled CNTs and graphene respectively. It is seen that, near percolation of the nano-additions, graphene-based systems exhibit an order of improvement in the piezoelectric response compared to the composite without nano modification. This improvement is comparable to CNT-based systems, but the matrix hardening is lesser than half the hardening observed in CNT-modified composites. This feature is due to a considerably smaller percolation threshold of graphene compared to CNTs which brings about percolative conditions at very small filler concentrations. We further investigate the dependence of the electric flux and fields in the graphene-modified piezocomposite on the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions to identify the polycrystalline configurations that can lead to improved performance in such nanomodified piezocomposites.",

    "abstract": "While lead-free piezocomposites offer an environmentally friendly solution to mechanical sensing and energy harvesting, they lag state-of-the-art lead-based materials in terms of performance. It is therefore important to develop new material designs to bridge this performance gap. Considering composites where rigid piezoelectric inclusions are embedded in soft matrices, a major cause of poor performance is weak coupling of applied strains to the inclusions. We show here that by designing matrices with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic matrices) it is possible to considerably improve this coupling. We first demonstrate this concept using a matrix which is inherently auxetic where we show an improvement of 40%\u201350% in the piezoelectric response. Based on the observations made, we develop a scalable design for auxetic matrices using conventional non-auxetic polymeric materials. This is done by embedding rigid auxetic structures in softer matrices. We show that with such designed auxetic matrices, which are amenable to fabrication through 3D printing, it is possible to achieve considerably larger piezoelectric response with a significant retention of the matrix softness. Particularly, we show that auxetic designs can show piezoelectric enhancements exceeding 300% compared to non-auxetic reference designs having similar a non-auxetic rigid backbone of similar volume as the auxetic backbone. Therefore, the use of matrices with negative Poisson's ratios is a promising design avenue to decouple mechanical coupling of strain to inclusions and matrix hardness. This strategy can pave way to design of softer piezocomposites with superior responses employing only structured polymeric materials without the use of expensive nanomaterials.\n\n",

    "abstract": "Improving the performance of lead-free piezocomposites to the levels of state-of-the-art lead-based composites has been an important challenge in composite research. Consequently, an important agenda of piezocomposite research has been to identify new coupled mechanisms that can enhance the piezoelectric response. One such method is to tap into the size-dependent flexoelectric phenomenon in geometrically anisotropic structures. Numerical models which can account for flexoelectricity and nonlinear effects such as electrostriction are not well-developed for piezocomposite design, and current designs are based on linear piezoelectric models. Here, we develop an advanced model with flexoelectric and electrostrictive contributions in geometrically tailored piezocomposites to obtain insights on aspects of enhanced response due to small-size effects. Here, based on design considerations, we numerically demonstrate that in epoxy-matrix-based piezocomposites which are structured as truncated pyramids, flexoelectricity can lead to significant enhancements in both the electric field and the electric flux generation at small length scales. Particularly, we show that at dilute inclusion concentrations, dramatic improvements nearing 150% in the piezoelectric response are possible. Further, the flexoelectric enhancement is sensitive to the packing of the inclusions within the composite structure with the best enhancements occurring when the inclusions are closer to the inclined edges of the pyramids. We also show that in composite structures with CNT-modified matrices, flexoelectricity produces similar enhancements as in the case of unmodified matrices, demonstrating that the effect operates almost independent of nanoscale elastic and dielectric modifications by the nanotubes. Finally, we also establish that for a large range of applied stresses, the nonlinear deviations in the response due to electrostriction are negligible and flexoelectricity is the predominant size-dependent enhancement mechanism in structured lead-free piezocomposites.\n",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous thermal ablation has proven to be an effective modality for treating both benign and malignant tumours in various tissues. Among these modalities, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most promising and widely adopted approach that has been extensively studied in the past decades. Microwave ablation (MWA) is a newly emerging modality that is gaining rapid momentum due to its capability of inducing rapid heating and attaining larger ablation volumes, and its lesser susceptibility to the heat sink effects as compared to RFA. Although the goal of both these therapies is to attain cell death in the target tissue by virtue of heating above 50\u00b0C, their underlying mechanism of action and principles greatly differs. Computational modelling is a powerful tool for studying the effect of electromagnetic interactions within the biological tissues and predicting the treatment outcomes during thermal ablative therapies. Such a priori estimation can assist the clinical practitioners during treatment planning with the goal of attaining successful tumour destruction and preservation of the surrounding healthy tissue and critical structures. This review provides current state-of-the-art developments and associated challenges in the computational modelling of thermal ablative techniques, viz., RFA and MWA, as well as touch upon several promising avenues in the modelling of laser ablation, nanoparticles assisted magnetic hyperthermia and non-invasive RFA. The application of RFA in pain relief has been extensively reviewed from modelling point of view.

Finite-element-based simulations were performed to compute the temperature and electrical field distribution during conventional RF procedures for treating pain, and exemplified here for the continuous case. The predicted results reveal that the consideration of heterogeneity within the computational domain results in distorted electric field distribution and leads to a significant reduction in the attained ablation volume during the continuous RF application for pain relief. The findings of this study could provide first-hand quantitative information to clinical practitioners about the impact of such heterogeneities on the efficacy of RF procedures, thereby assisting them in developing standardized optimal protocols for different cases of interest.\n\n",

    "abstract": "Biological cells are exposed to a variety of mechanical loads throughout their life cycles that eventually play an important role in a wide range of cellular processes. The understanding of cell mechanics under the application of external stimuli is important for capturing the nuances of physiological and pathological events. Such critical knowledge will play an increasingly vital role in modern medical therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, as well as in the development of new remedial treatments. At present, it is well known that the biological molecules exhibit piezoelectric properties that are of great interest for medical applications ranging from sensing to surgery. In the current study, a coupled electro-mechanical model of a biological cell has been developed to better understand the complex behaviour of biological cells subjected to piezoelectric and flexoelectric properties of their constituent organelles under the application of external forces. Importantly, a more accurate modelling paradigm has been presented to capture the nonlocal flexoelectric effect in addition to the linear piezoelectric effect based on the finite element method. Major cellular organelles considered in the developed computational model of the biological cell are the nucleus, mitochondria, microtubules, cell membrane and cytoplasm. The effects of variations in the applied forces on the intrinsic piezoelectric and flexoelectric contributions to the electro-elastic response have been systematically investigated along with accounting for the variation in the coupling coefficients. In addition, the effect of mechanical degradation of the cytoskeleton on the electro-elastic response has also been quantified. The present studies suggest that flexoelectricity could be a dominant electro-elastic coupling phenomenon, exhibiting electric fields that are four orders of magnitude higher than those generated by piezoelectric effects alone. Further, the output of the coupled electro-mechanical model is significantly dependent on the variation of flexoelectric coefficients. We have found that the mechanical degradation of the cytoskeleton results in the enhancement of both the piezo and flexoelectric responses associated with electro-mechanical coupling. In general, our study provides a framework for more accurate quantification of the mechanical/electrical transduction within the biological cells that can be critical for capturing the complex mechanisms at cellular length scales.\n\n",

The time-dependent phenomenological model is employed to capture the hysteresis loops associated with phase transitions. The fatigue hysteresis is modeled by combining the single-crystal model with time functions. The mechanism of fatigue in ferroelectric ceramics is interpreted as an accumulation of residual polarization in the proposed model. Numerical results of static and dynamic hysteretic behaviors are presented and compared to their experimental counterparts. The capability of the proposed model for capturing the fatigue phenomenon is validated.",

    "abstract": "Shape memory alloy (SMA) is a very important smart material, which has been widely used in many fields, especially in vibration. Phase transformation can be induced by changing temperature and its stiffness changes accordingly. In this paper, the primary resonance vibration of a one-dimensional SMA oscillator is analyzed using the harmonic balance (HB) method. The amplitude-frequency curves of the SMA oscillator with different temperatures are drawn, and the effect of temperature and frequency on the amplitude is discussed. Then, the energy flow of SMA in the vibration process is researched by the power flow analysis (PFA) approach. The time-averaged input power (TAIP) is calculated using the analytical and numerical method, respectively, and the calculation time is compared. It is found that the difference between the analytical and numerical solutions is not significant in most cases, but the calculation time of analytical solution is only about one-tenth of that of the numerical solution, which is very important in saving computational cost, real-time control and so on. Finally, some other characteristics of energy flow in the SMA oscillator are identified.",

The dependence of the energy dissipation on the bias voltage, frequency, and resistance is analysed in detail. The energy dissipation density in one cycle is calculated. It is shown that the resistance has a strong influence on the energy dissipation.

Computational modeling provides a safe and viable alternative to ex vivo and in vivo experimental studies for quantifying the effects of different variables efficiently and reliably, apart from providing a priori estimates of the ablation volume attained during cardiac ablation procedures. In this contribution, we report a fully coupled electrothermomechanical model for a more accurate prediction of the treatment outcomes during the radio frequency cardiac ablation. A numerical model comprising of cardiac tissue and the cardiac chamber has been developed in which an electrode has been inserted perpendicular to the cardiac tissue to simulate actual clinical procedures. Temperature-dependent heat capacity, electrical and thermal conductivities, and blood perfusion rate have been considered to model more realistic scenarios. The effects of blood flow and contact force of the electrode tip on the treatment outcomes of a fully coupled model of RFA have been systematically investigated. The numerical study demonstrates that the predicted ablation volume of RFA is significantly dependent on the blood flow rate in the cardiac chamber and also on the tissue deformation induced due to electrode insertion depth of 1.5\u2009mm or higher.",

In this paper we develop Coarse-Grained (CG) models for RNA nanotubes and then, by using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, we study their physical properties. Our exemplifications include RNA nanotubes of 40 nm long, equivalent to 10 RNA nanorings connected in series. The developed methodology is based on a coarse-grained representation of RNA nanotubes, where each coarse bead represents a group of atoms. By decreasing computation cost, this allows us to make computations feasible for realistic structures of interest. In particular, for the developed coarse-grained models with three bead approximations, we calculate the histograms for the bond angles and the dihedral angles. From the dihedral angle histograms, we analyze the characteristics of the links used to build the nanotubes. Furthermore, we also calculate the bead distances along the chains of RNA strands in the nanoclusters. The variations in these features with the size of the nanotube are discussed in detail. Finally, we present the results on the calculation of the root mean square deviations for a developed RNA nanotube to demonstrate the equilibration of the systems for drug delivery and other biomedical applications such as medical imaging and tissue engineering.",

In this review, we discuss the mathematical formulations and computational modeling of some of the light harvesting complexes including FMO. The most recent research developments in the photosynthetic light harvesting complexes are thoroughly discussed. The theoretical background related to the spectral density, quantum coherence and density functional theory has been elaborated. Furthermore, details about the transfer and excitation of energy in different sites of the FMO complex along with other vital photosynthetic light harvesting complexes have also been provided.

In particular, the equations of the derivative expansion up to the \u22022 order for a scalar model are derived in a suitable form, clarifying the role of the off-diagonal terms in the matrix of functional derivatives. The natural domain of validity of the derivative expansion appears to be limited to small values of q/k in the calculation of the critical two-point correlation function, depending on the wave-vector magnitude q and the infrared cut-off scale k. The new approximation scheme has the advantage to be valid for any q/k, and, therefore, it can be auspicious in many current and potential applications of the celebrated Wetterich equation and similar models. Contrary to the derivative expansion, derivatives are not truncated at a finite order in the new scheme. The RG flow equations in the first approximation of this new scheme are derived and approximately solved as an example. It is shown that the derivative expansion up to the \u22022 order is just the small-q approximation of our new equations at the first order of truncation.",

The expressions are derived from orientational averages of third-order piezoelectric tensors of the individual crystals that are weighted by orientational distribution functions. The averaging is done by using generalized spherical harmonic series expansions. Improvements with respect to previous works in the literature are twofold: all crystal symmetries are considered and no symmetry restrictions are imposed to texture. The versatility of the introduced expressions is demonstrated on an example of BaTiO3 polycrystals with uniaxial and biaxial textures characterized by single and double Gaussian distributions, respectively. The results for uniaxial texture are in perfect agreement with the results published in the literature. The biaxial texture is discussed in detail and analyzed for a set of limiting cases.",

    "abstract": "The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.",

These eight hubs (Putamen, Caudate, Hippocampus and Thalamus-Proper in the left and right cerebral hemisphere) are the highest-ranking according to their topological dimension, defined as the number of simplexes of all orders in which the node participates. Furthermore, we analyse the weight-dependent heterogeneity of simplexes. We demonstrate changes in the structure of identified core networks and topological entropy when the threshold weight is gradually increased. These results highlight the role of higher-order interactions in human brain networks and provide additional evidence for (dis)similarity between the female and male connectomes.",

    "abstract": "Multiscale material design has made it possible to control the properties of a material through introducing structures at multiple length scales. This structuring brings about unusual material behaviour that is not seen in a continuum material. Here we introduce a multiscale design for the matrix components of a lead\u2010free piezocomposite. This combines a microscale stiff polymeric structure embedded within a softer matrix to form a composite matrix. By controlling the microscale features of the embedded structure, we tune the mechanical behaviour of the matrix by rendering it either nonauxetic (hexagonal structure) or auxetic (inverted hexagonal structure). Further, the mechanical and electrical properties of the matrix are controlled at the nanoscale by addition of carbon nanotubes within the embedded polymeric structure. By engineering the matrix at the nano and the microscale, we firstly demonstrate that the auxetic matrix can result in three orders of magnitude higher piezoelectric response by amplifying the strains within the piezoelectric inclusions. We further demonstrate that by using the matrix with the nonauxetic embedded structure, it is possible to design piezoelectric composites with pronounced anisotropy in their longitudinal and transverse responses. This is an important requirement for designing materials with directional sensing ability. Our findings show that the multiscale material design proposed here has important implications for both energy harvesting and directional sensing. Further, the approach taken here yields considerable performance improvements while using limited quantities of nanomaterial. The multiscale matrix design is scalable and amenable to fabrication through emerging methods such as additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "In this present work, forced convection heat transfer from a heated blunt-headed cylinder in power-law fluids has been investigated numerically over the range of parameters, namely, Reynolds number (Re): 1\u201340, Prandtl number (Pr): 10\u2013100 and power-law index (n): 0.3\u20131.8. The results are expressed in terms of local parameters, like streamline, isotherm, pressure coefficient, and local Nusselt number and global parameters, like wake length, drag coefficient, and average Nusselt number. The length of the recirculation zone on the rear side of the cylinder increases with the increasing value of Re and n. The effect of the total drag coefficient acting on the cylinder is seen to be higher at the low value of Re and its effect significant in shear-thinning fluids (n< 1). On the heat transfer aspect, the rate of heat transfer in fluids is increased by increasing the value of Re and Pr. The effect of heat transfer is enhanced in shear-thinning fluids up to\u223c 40% and it impedes it\u2019s to\u223c 20% shear-thickening fluids. In the end, the numerical results of the total drag coefficient and average Nusselt number (in terms of JH\u2212factor) have been correlated by simple expression to estimate the intermediate value for the new application.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale systems fabricated with low-dimensional nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, quantum dots, and more recently graphene sheets, have fascinated researchers from different fields due to their extraordinary and unique physical properties. For example, the remarkable mechanical properties of nanowires empower them to have a very high resonant frequency up to the order of giga to terahertz. In this paper, we originally propose a nonlinear model for the vibrations of piezoelectric nanowire resonators with added mass considering thermal variation, electromagnetic field, surface effects, external excitation, and nonlinear foundation. The mathematical model for such nanowires is formulated by applying the Euler\u2013 Bernoulli beam theory in conjunction with the nonlocal differential constitutive relations of Eringen type. In order to analyze the obtained nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), we first use the Galerkin method in combination with a perturbation technique to obtain the primary and super-harmonic resonances. After finding the resonance cases, a parametric sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of key parameters on the sensitivity of the nanowire resonators in mass sensing. Our main hypothesis is that tiny particles attached to the surface of the nanowire resonator would result in a detectable shift in the value of the jump frequency. The sensitivity analysis shows that the nanowire resonator is capable of detecting added mass in the order of zeptogram. In addition, we have developed a system identification technique based on the proposed mathematical model for the detection of tiny mass rested on the nanowire resonator that we have analyzed. Furthermore, a molecular dynamic simulation study has been presented to qualitatively verify the hypothesis of frequency shift due to the added mass. The results demonstrate a high potential of nanowire resonators in detecting tiny bio-particles such as DNA, RNA, proteins, viruses, and bacteria.",

The study focuses on the different aspects of controlled therapeutic exosomal release by computing the modulated release rate and the concentration of released exosomes. The results are based on a developed mathematical model that combines: i) cell depolarization, ii) intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and iii) vesicular exocytosis. Furthermore, we have also investigated the possible role of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations of astrocytes. A modified Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal model has been used to describe the electrical activity of a depolarized neuron via membrane potential for initiation and propagation of action potentials. The intracellular Ca2+ dynamics have been modelled by coupling the neuronal electrical activity and Ca 2+mediated exocytosis, taking into account the high-voltage (L-type) and low-voltage (T-type) activated Ca2+ channels, plasma membrane, bulk cytosol and ER. The developed model has been extended to quantify the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes for investigating the effects of A\u03b2 on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and astrocytes. A comparative analysis has been further conducted to quantify the effect of temperature on the Ca2+ dynamics mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and amyloid-beta in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This study have also accounted for the temperature threshold dependence on Ca2+ dynamics incorporating coldsensing neurons. The obtained results highlight the role of TRPM8 and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in setting the temperature dependent activation and inactivation at various threshold levels.",

    "abstract": "The recent experience of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics spreading revealed the importance of passive forms of infection transmissions. Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and to unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes. The model accounts for each human actor\u2019s susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Radiofrequency (RF) assisted cardiac ablation has already proved to be one of the most widely used first-line treatment options for treating cardiac arrhythmias. The objective of this study is to develop a fully coupled model of RF-assisted cardiac ablation, incorporating fluid-structure interaction (FSI), thermal relaxation time effects and porous media approach, for more accurate predictions of the treatment outcomes that could be easily translated into the treatment planning stage.\n\nMethods: Three-dimensional model of the cardiac ablation has been developed that comprises of the fragment of cardiac tissue, blood chamber and RF electrode. Cardiac tissue has been modeled as a porous media, surrounded by the blood flow within the cardiac chamber. The electric field distributions have been obtained utilizing the quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell\u2019s equations. A non-Fourier based bio-heat transfer model has been used for predicting the temperature distribution and ablation zone during the cardiac ablation. The blood has been modeled as a Newtonian fluid and the velocity fields are obtained utilizing the Navier-Stokes equations. The thermal stresses induced due to the heating of the cardiac tissue have also been accounted by incorporating the solid mechanics module. The fully coupled electro-thermo-mechanical model has been solved utilizing a finite element based COMSOL Multiphysics software.\n\nResults: Parametric studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of cardiac tissue porosity, thermal relaxation time effects, electrode insertion depths and orientations on the treatment outcomes of the cardiac ablation. The results are presented in terms of predicted temperature distributions and ablation volumes for different cases of interest. It has been found that the electrode insertion depth and orientation has a significant effect on the treatment outcomes of cardiac ablation. Further, the porosity of the cardiac tissue also plays an important role in the prediction of temperature distribution and ablation volume during 2 RF-assisted cardiac ablation. Moreover, the thermal relaxation times effect only the treatment outcomes for shorter treatment times, less than 30 s.\n\nConclusions: The presented results would assist the clinicians in the treatment planning stage of the therapies by providing key quantitative information about the effect of critical factors on the efficacy of the cardiac ablation.",

In the current paper, a differential model is proposed to describe the hysteresis in MSMAs caused by magnetic field induced martensite reorientation based on Landau theory of phase transitions. First, the three-dimensional model is simplified into a one-dimensional case, and the hysteresis in MSMAs is described by three martensite variant orientations. Then, a traditional Landau free energy is introduced, and the traditional Landau model is obtained by using the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation. However, it is found that the prediction accuracy of the model is not ideal compared with the experimental data. Thus, an improved model is proposed, and the traditional Landau free energy is replaced by a function that can be determined by the easily measured physical quantities in the experimental curve. Numerical experiments show that the prediction effect of the improved model is much better than the traditional Landau model, and the stress dependence is also demonstrated. Moreover, the proposed improved model has the advantages for dynamic analysis and control with its differential form. Therefore, the frequency dependence of the improved model is demonstrated and a feedback linearization control methodology is proposed to make the system develops in the desired trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Studies of many complex systems have revealed new collective behaviours that emerge through the mechanisms of self-organised critical fluctuations. Subject to the external and endogenous driving forces, these collective states with long-range spatial and temporal correlations often arise from the intrinsic dynamics with the threshold nonlinearity and geometry-conditioned interactions. The self-similarity of critical fluctuations enables us to describe the system using fewer parameters and universal functions that, on the other hand, can simplify the computational and information complexity. Currently, the cutting-edge research on self-organised critical systems across the scales strives to formulate a unifying mathematical framework, utilise the critical universal properties in information theory, and decipher the role of hidden geometry. As a prominent example, we study the field-driven spin dynamics on the hysteresis loop in a network with higher-order structures described by simplicial complexes, which provides a geometric-frustration environment. While providing motivational illustrations from physical, biological, and social systems, along with their networks, we also demonstrate how the self-organised criticality occurs at the interplay of the complex topology and driving mode. This study opens up new promising routes with powerful tools to address a long-standing challenge in the theory and applications of complexity science ingrained in the efficient analysis of self-organised critical states under the competing higher-order interactions embedded in complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal models are ubiquitous in all branches of science and engineering, with a rapidly expanding range of mathematical and computational applications due to the ability of such models to capture effects and phenomena that traditional models cannot. While spatial nonlocalities have received considerable attention in the research community, the same cannot be said about nonlocality in time, in particular when nonlocal initial conditions are present. This paper aims at filling this gap, providing an overview of the current status of nonlocal models and focusing on the mathematical treatment of such models when nonlocal initial conditions are at the heart of the problem. Specifically, our representative example is given for a nonlocal-in-time problem for the abstract Schr\u00f6dinger equation. By exploiting the linear nature of nonlocal conditions, we derive an exact representation of the solution operator under assumptions that the spectrum of Hamiltonian is contained in the horizontal strip of the complex plane. The derived representation permits us to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem\u2019s well-posedness and the existence of its solution under different regularities. Furthermore, we present new sufficient conditions for the existence of the solution that extend the existing results in this field to the case when some nonlocal parameters are unbounded. Two further examples demonstrate the developed methodology and highlight the importance of its computer algebra component in the reduction procedures and parameter estimations for nonlocal models. Finally, a connection of the considered models and developed analysis is discussed in the context of other reduction techniques, concentrating on the most promising from the viewpoint of data-driven modelling environments, and providing directions for further generalizations.",

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation is one of the most widely used methods for characterizing the mechanical properties and response of the living cells. In this contribution, we highlight main consequences of auxeticity for biosystems and provide a representative example to quantify the effect of nucleus auxeticity on the force response of the embryonic stem cells. A parametric study has been conducted on a heterogeneous stem cell to evaluate the effect of nucleus diameter, nucleus elasticity, indenter\u2019s shape and location on the force-indentation curve. The developed model has also been validated with the recently reported experimental studies available in the literature. Our results suggest that the nucleus auxeticity plays a profound role in cell mechanics especially for large size nucleus. We also report the mechanical stresses induced within the hyperelastic cell model under different loading conditions that would be quite useful in decoding the interrelations between mechanical stimuli and cellular behavior of auxetic biosystems.

Indeed, it is known that aberrant beta(13\u221230Hz)oscillations and the loss ofdopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia-thalamus (BGTH) and cortex characterize theakinesia symptoms of PD. However, the relevant biophysical mechanism behind this processstill remains unclear. Based on the prior striatal inhibitory model, we propose an extendedBGTH model incorporating medium spine neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons(FSIs) along with the effect of DBS. We are focusing in this paper on an open-loop DBSmode, where the stimulation parameters stay constant independent of variations in thedisease state, and modifications of parameters rely mainly on trial and error of medicalexperts. Additionally, we propose a novel combined model of the cerebellar-basal-gangliathalamocortical network, MSNs, and FSIs, and show new results that indicate that Parkin-sonian oscillations in the beta-band frequency range emerge from the dynamics of such anetwork. Our model predicts that DBS can be used to suppress beta oscillations in globuspallidus pars interna (GPi) neurons.

    "abstract": "Shape  memory  materials  have  been  playing  an  important  role  in  a  wide  range of  bioengineering  applications.   At  the  same  time,  recent  developments  of  graphene-based nanostructures,  such as nanoribbons,  have demonstrated that,  due to the unique properties of graphene, they can manifest superior electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical characteristics ideally suited for their potential usage for the next generation of diagnostic devices, drug delivery systems,  and  other  biomedical  applications.   One  of  the  most  intriguing  parts  of  these  new developments lies in the fact that certain types of such graphene nanoribbons can exhibit shape memory effects. In this paper, we apply machine learning tools to build an interatomic potential from  DFT  calculations  for  highly  ordered  graphene  oxide  nanoribbons,  a  material  that  had demonstrated  shape  memory  effects  with  a  recovery  strain  up  to  14.5%  for  2D  layers.   The graphene oxide layer can shrink to a metastable phase with lower constant lattice through the application of an electric field, and returns to the initial phase through an external mechanical force. The deformation leads to an electronic rearrangement and induces magnetization around the oxygen atoms. DFT calculations show no magnetization for sufficiently narrow nanoribbons, while the machine learning model can predict the suppression of the metastable phase for the same narrower nanoribbons. We can improve the prediction accuracy by analyzing only the evolution of the metastable phase, where no magnetization is found according to DFT calculations. The model developed here allows also us to study the evolution of the phases for wider nanoribbons, that would be computationally inaccessible through a pure DFT approach. Moreover, we extend our analysis to realistic systems that include vacancies and boron or nitrogen impurities at the oxygen atomic positions. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the current and potential applications of the materials exhibiting shape memory effects in bioengineering and biomedical fields.",

Motivated byimportant applications of queueing networks and neuroscience, the main focusof the present work is on the analysis of reflecting stochastic dynamics of suchmixed populations.  We develop a general mathematical modeling framework todescribe the reflecting stochastic dynamics for active-passive populations.  Theanalysis of this model is carried out via a combination of low- and high-delityresults obtained from the solution of the underlying coupled system of SDEs andfrom the simulations with a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, wherewe employ a kinetic Monte Carlo procedure.  We provide details of the queueingtheory and neuronal models and discuss a relationship between reflecting SDEsand a model of queueing theory via a limit theorem.  Furthermore, we presentseveral representative numerical examples, and discuss an intrinsic interconnec-tion between active and passive particles in the underlying stochastic process.",

    "abstract": "The modelling of human crowd behaviors offers many challenging questions to science in general. Specifically, the social human behavior consists of many physiological and psychological processes which are still largely unknown. To model reliably such human crowd systems with complex social interactions, stochastic tools play an important role for the setting of mathematical formulations of the problems. In this work, using the description based on an exclusion principle, we study a statistical- mechanics-based lattice gas model for active-passive population dynamics with an application to human crowd behaviors. We provide representative numerical examples for the evacuation dynamics of human crowds, where the main focus in our considerations is given to an interacting particle system of active and passive human groups. Furthermore, our numerical results show that the communication between active and passive humans strongly influences the evacuation time of the whole population even when the \u201cfaster-is-slower\u201d phenomenon is taken into account. Finally, to provide an additional inside into the problem, a stationary state of our model is analyzed via current representations and heat map techniques.",

    "type": "Journal",
    "abstract": "Our brain is a complex information processing network in which the nervous system receives information from the environment to quickly react to incoming events or learns from experience to sharp our memory. In the nervous system, the brain states translate collective activities of neurons interconnected via synaptic connections. In this paper, we study a model of coupled effects of channels and synaptic dynamics in stochastic modelling of healthy brain cells with applications to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). In particular, we consider a cell membrane potential model in the thalamus part of the human brain. This model allows us to deal with an array of coupled small-scale neural subsystems. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) bursting phenomena and parkinsonian hypokinetic motor symptoms are closely connected, as electrical and chemical maneuvers modulating STN bursts are sufficient to ameliorate or mimic parkinsonian motor deficits. One of the main factors that causes the burst discharges in STN is adequately available calcium (Ca2+) currents. Our numerical results show that controlling the dynamics of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and calcium (Ca2+) channels together with the presences of additive and multiplicative noises in the cell membrane potential model decreases the burst discharges in STN. These burst discharges in STN contribute to slow the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and improve motor symptoms in PD. Furthermore, we show that the presence of noise with suitable choices of parameters in the system could delay the burst discharges in STN.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that today nearly one in six of the world\u2019s population has to deal with neurodegenerative disorders. While a number of medical devices have been developed for the detection, prevention, and treatments of such disorders, some fundamentals of the progression of associated diseases are in urgent need of further clarification. In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, where it is believed that the concentration changes in amyloid-beta and tau proteins play a central role in its onset and development. A multiscale model is proposed to analyze the propagation of these concentrations in the brain connectome. In particular, we consider a modified heterodimer model for the protein-protein interactions. Higher toxic concentrations of amyloid-beta and tau proteins destroy the brain cell. We have studied these propagations for the primary and secondary and their mixed tauopathy. We model the damage of a brain cell by the nonlocal contributions of these toxic loads present in the brain cells. With the help of rigorous analysis, we check the stability behaviour of the stationary points corresponding to the homogeneous system. After integrating the brain connectome data into the developed model, we see that the spreading patterns of the toxic concentrations for the whole brain are the same, but their concentrations are different in different regions. Also, the time to propagate the damage in each region of the brain connectome is different.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a 2D phenomenological model to characterize the thermo- magneto-mechanical coupled behaviour for martensitic variant reorientation in\nferromagnetic shape memory alloys. The Landau free energy function is employed to\naccount for the hysteretic nonlinearity in the reorientation of martensitic variants. A\nset of state variables are chosen to describe different microscopic mechanisms, and\nthe evolution rules of the state variables are determined via the Lagrange equation. To\nvalidate the model capability, the model formulation is numerically implemented for\nthe typical loading condition (i.e. uniaxial stress and a perpendicular magnetic field). Model predictions are compared with experimental results, and good correlations\ndemonstrate the magneto-mechanical coupling capacity of the model as well as its\ntemperature-dependent nature.",

    "abstract": "A novel design of a jellyfish-inspired mantle undulated propulsion robot is presented, aiming at a swimmer with good orientation and high propulsion efficiency. An\neffective reduced-order model is proposed to establish the mapping between the\nparameter-driven motion of the mantle and the evolution of the fluid characteristics\naround the swimmer. Moreover, to predict new cases where the input needs to be\nupdated, the input of the proposed model is taken in the form of a sinusoidal signal\nextracted from the kinematics of the robot rather than extracted from full-order\nsystems. The results show that compared with other models, the proposed method can\nefficiently update the input, providing reasonable predictions for new cases. The\nanalysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed robot pinpoints that, under\na certain period and a certain tail beat amplitude, the hydrodynamic force generated\nby swinging-like mantle motion (k<0.5) is greater, but it is accompanied by\nconsiderable power loss. It is demonstrated that considering a certain power loss and a\ncertain tail beat amplitude, the wave-like mantle motion (k>0.5) can produce greater\npropulsion, which means higher propulsion efficiency.
