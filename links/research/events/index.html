                           <h3>SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP</h3>
                           <p>
                              Further progress in studying bio- and
                              nanotechnological systems relies on the
                              development of novel and reliable mathematical
                              models and efficient and accurate computational
                              tools. The main objectives of this minisymposium
                              are centered on bringing together applied
                              mathematicians, computational scientists, 
                              physicists, biologists and engineers to discuss
                              multiphysics/multiscale mathematical models and
                              numerical methodologies for their solution,
                              focusing on coupled processes in bio- and
                              nanotechnological systems.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              This minisymposium is aimed at exploring the links
                              between Life Sciences and Nanotechnology. The key
                              to success in this ambitious endeavor lies with
                              the observation that "material" devices and "in
                              vivo" biological systems often share common
                              structures, functioning and driving mechanisms. In
                              this perspective, the use of appropriate
                              mathematical and computational models to better
                              understand such mechanisms, and even predict
                              possible collateral (undesired) effects, becomes
                              increasingly important. It contributes further to
                              the development of novel bio- and
                              nanotechnologies, as well as to our better
                              understanding of physiology and pathologies of
                              biological systems. In most cases, the associated
                              mathematical models are described by coupled
                              systems either of differential/difference and/or
                              integral equations which require efficient
                              computational techniques for their solution.

                              This minisymposium will address challenges related
                              to the solution of such problems and will provide
                              a forum to the researchers working in this field,
                              encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.

                              (CMSNB) is embedded into the 10th US National
                              Congress on Computational Mechanics which will be
                              held at the Greater Columbus Convention Center,
                              OH, USA from July 16, 2009 till July 19, 2009.

                           <h3>SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP</h3>
                           <p>
                              Along with their fascinating applications, new
                              structures and devices on scales between a
                              nanometer and a micron bring new fundamental
                              challenges to nanomechanics that can only be
                              addressed efficiently by joint efforts of
                              interdisciplinary groups of researchers. This
                              minisymposium aims at bringing together
                              scientists, engineers,  and applied mathematicians
                              working in the rapidly evolving field of
                              nanoscience  in order to discuss state-of-the-art
                              models, procedures, and computational algorithms
                              for the analysis of  coupled processes and
                              phenomena encountered in nanotechnological and
                              bio-nanotechnological applications. This includes,
                              but not limited to, new technologies based on
                              low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures
                              (quantum dots, wires, wells), nanotubes,
                              interaction of nanoobjects with biological systems
                              such as DNA, proteins, RNA, and bioconjugates. We
                              welcome contributions on such applications of
                              nanostructures. Coupled processes and phenomena
                              are of increasing importance in nanomechanics due
                              to the sensitivity of nanomaterials and devices to
                              combined (multiphysics) effects of mechanical, 
                              thermal and other fields that can lead to complete
                              or partial failure.  Such combined effects lead
                              frequently to new physics and bring serious new
                              challenges in the analysis and modeling of
                              nanostructures.  For example, electromechanical
                              field couplings in nanostructures can be
                              qualitatively very different as compared to
                              classical structures.  We welcome contributions
                              seeking to identify the most important differences
                              between nano- and classical structures and
                              consequences for basic physical properties and
                              applications.  We are equally interested in
                              contributions that discuss applications, stability
                              and accuracy of combined atomistic and continuum
                              simulations of nanostructures. Multiscale modeling
                              presentations are especially encouraged in the
                              context of coupled phenomena and processes that
                              are becoming increasingly important in the
                              modeling of low dimensional nanostructures and
                              their applications.

                           <h3>SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP</h3>
                           <p>
                              Further progress in nano- and biotechnologies
                              relies at a large extent on the development of
                              novel and reliable mathematical models and
                              efficient and accurate computational tools. This
                              minisymposium aims at bringing together applied
                              mathematicians, computational scientists, 
                              physicists, biologists and engineers to discuss
                              multiphysics mathematical models and numerical
                              methodologies for their solution, in the context
                              of existing and new applications of such models in
                              nano- and biotechnologies.  Although analytical
                              techniques can often provide a good insight into
                              the problem, in most cases the complexity of the
                              models necessarily requires to adopt numerical
                              approaches for their solution. Hence, a major
                              focus of this minisymposium is on the development
                              of efficient computational tools for the numerical
                              analysis of such models, on the development of new
                              models, and on their applications in the rapidly
                              developing areas of nano- and biotechnologies.
                              This includes, but is not limited to, new
                              technologies based on low-dimensional
                              semiconductor nanostructures, nanotubes, bio-and
                              nanoelectronics, interaction of nanoobjects with
                              DNA, tissue engineering, systems biology based
                              technologies, and technologies that may assist
                              clinical studies and disease treatments. 
                              Mathematical problems arising in this context have
                              often a multiphysics nature and are characterized
                              by the simultaneous presence of several widely
                              varying spatial and temporal scales. In most
                              cases, the associated mathematical models are
                              described by coupled systems either of
                              differential/difference and/or integral equations
                              which require efficient computational techniques
                              for their solution. This minisymposium will
                              address challenges related to the solution of such
                              problems and will provide a forum to the
                              researchers working in this field, encouraging
                              interdisciplinary collaborations.

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p align="left"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho';">The 2006 Minisymposium on<em>Transport and Coupled Processes  in Micro- and Nanotechnology</em> is organized as a special session at The 7th World Congress on Computational Mechanics.  The 2006 meeting will take place in Los Angeles on July 16 - 22, 2006.</span></p>
<center>
<h3>SCOPE OF THE MINISYMPOSIUM</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">As the range of applications of micro- and nanostructures continues to grow, the role of mathematical models and computational experiments in this field becomes increasingly important. Designing of and working with structures and devices on scales between a nanometer and a micron bring new fundamental challenges that can be addressed by combined efforts of researchers working in chemical kinetics, micro-scale fluid dynamics, heat-transfer, mathematical modeling, micro-scale solid mechanics and solid-state physics.<br /><br /> This minisymposium aims at bringing together engineers, mathematicians, and scientists working in this rapidly evolving field in order to discuss state-of-the-art models, procedures, and algorithms for the analysis of  transport and coupled processes and phenomena encountered in micro- and nanotechnological applications. Such processes and phenomena are of increasing importance due to extreme sensitivity of nanomaterials and devices to mechanical, thermal and other effects that can lead to complete or partial failure.<br />  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The minisymposium will include the discussion of micro-fluidics applications, thermo-fluids aspects of synthesis of macromolecules including carbon nanotubes, the analysis of semiconductor heterostructures, sensor and actuator control schemes on micro- and nano- levels as well as biotechnological applications. We are interested in a hierarchical modeling approach and welcome contributions that discuss all aspects of modeling matter at the molecular/atomistic level and life at the cellular level, as well as contributions dealing with continuum mechanics methodologies in particular when the authors discuss the validity of these methods for micro- and nano- scale phenomena. Among other application areas, we welcome contributions in modeling of high-energy phenomena in a small scale range such as a short-pulse laser ablation. We are also interested in contributions that discuss applications, stability and accuracy of combined atomistic and continuum simulations. Multi-scale modeling presentations are especially encouraged in the context of transport and coupled phenomena and processes encountered in micro- and nanotechnology.<br /><br /> Contributions on other aspects of transport and coupled phenomena and processes in the context of micro- and nanotechnological applications are welcome. This includes educational aspects and industrial implementations.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p align="left"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho';">The 2005 Minisymposium on<em>Modeling Coupled and Transport Phenomena in Nanotechnology</em> is organized as a special session at The Third M.I.T. Conference on Computational Fluid and Solid Mechanics.  The previous meetings in this series took place in 2001 and 2003 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.. The 2005 meeting will take place at M.I.T. on June 14 - 17, 2005.</span></p>

<h3>SCOPE OF THE MINISYMPOSIUM</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Nanoscale phenomena can be understood better by using tools of mathematical modelling and computational experiment applied at the interface of atomistic and molecular modeling and continuous solid and fluid mechanics. The forces of different range and scale are present in nanoscale phenomena including inter-atomic, magnetic, and electrical. Stress-induced and thermal effects may influence the properties of nanostructures and are often of fundamental importance in describing many phenomena at the nanoscale level. The numerical algorithms that are capable of handling these coupled phenomena and the physical description of nanoscale phenomena obtained by numerical modeling  are in the main focus of this minisymposium.<br /><br /> Motion of submicron charged particles in nanoscale self-assembly processes, motion of feedstock gas in production of carbon nanotubes, and carrier dynamics in semiconductor heterostructures applied in electronic industry are important examples of coupled and transport phenomena at the nanoscale level. The effect of such coupled and transport phenomena on the properties of nanomaterials and nanostructures is one of the major topics of the minisymposium.<br /><br /><em><span style="font-size: small;">In what follows we describe briefly two areas of major interest for the coming workshop.<br /><br /> 1. The tendency of ultra-large scale integration of electronic components will continue into the future, requiring new models and tools to be developed. In this context, we are particularly interested in contributions dealing with non-local mathematical models that are able to describe non-equilibrium transport of semiconductor plasma. We are interested in contributions dealing with new models and algorithms in quantum semiconductor physics that play a fundamental role in many nanotechnological applications. Our focus in this context is the modelling of semiconductor superlattices and low-dimensional semiconductor systems such as quantum dots, wires, and rods, and the description of their opto-electromechanical properties. Due to atomistic discontinuities at interfaces between different materials it is possible to take advantage of confined nanoscale quantum states in such structures. Contributions addressing challenges associated with the modelling of such structures and their applications are most welcome.  <br /><br /> 2. Transport phenomena are especially important for technological applications and continuous production, handling, and use of nano-materials. The majority of carbon nanotube synthesis processes occur in the presence of fluid (liquid, gas, plasma, or multi-phase flow) that may function as carrier of catalyst particles, feedstock of carbon, and the heating or cooling agent. The fluid motion defines the temperature of catalyst particles and the local chemical composition of the fluid that determines the success of nanotube synthesis. We welcome contributions on the multi-model approach for concurrent rendering of different areas of computational domain by different models and/or different time steps for the same model.  For example, in multiple plume ejection in laser ablation method for production of nanotubes, the near-target area should be rendered by molecular dynamics approach whereas continuous gas dynamics algorithms should be employed to simulate plume dynamics of previously ejected plumes apart of the target. Despite the nano-scale of the final product, it is unnecessary and unrealistic to resolve the entire flow-field in the reactor in nano-meters scale of spatial resolution. The thermo-fluid modeling of synthesis of CN requires multi-scale approach that combines (i) continuous mechanics of multi-species and/or multi-phase flow, (ii) micro-fluidic flow model that is needed to find heat and mass transfer coefficients for fluid flow about individual  CNs, and (iii) molecular dynamics. The components of models of synthesis of nano-materials will be presented in the minisymposium and include the above-mentioned multi-model approach, the switching criteria between models,  data exchange between different models or parts of computational domain, the local grid refinement, and the model decomposition approach.</span></em></p>

<h3>CALL FOR PAPERS</h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black;"> Prospective authors are invited to submit to one of the organizers of this minisymposium a Short Paper by September the 25, 2004.</span>Your Short Paper may contain up to 1600 words, plus up to four figures or tables (in total). If the total number of figures or tables exceeds four, your word count should be reduced by approximately 100 words per additional figure or table. Further details and templates are given at the conference site.</p>
<p align="left">Please note that the proceedings will be typeset by the publisher, Elsevier Science, and hence manuscripts should be submitted in a single column format, double spaced. All papers will be reviewed. A copyright transfer form will be sent to authors upon acceptance of their contribution. Authors will also be sent proofs for checking (anticipated January to March 2005). As the Proceedings are being published to a fixed schedule, prompt return of proofs is essential. The publisher reserves the right to publish papers directly from the proof copy if authors have not returned their corrected proofs on schedule. This is important to ensure that the Proceedings are available at conference registration.  Authors will be informed prior to December 30, 2004 regarding acceptance of their contribution for presentation at the Conference and publication in the Proceedings.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>The 2004 Workshop on<em>Coupled Problems, Processes, and Phenomena</em> (CPPP) is embedded into the Fourth World Congress of Nonlinear Analysts (WCNA-2004) which will be held in Orlando (Florida), USA from June 30, 2004 till July 7, 2004. Past WCNAs have been held in Tampa (Florida), the Athens (Greece), and Catania (Italy).</p>
<h3>SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP</h3>
<p>This workshop will concentrate on problems related to modelling, full and reduced-order approximations, control, and analysis of coupled nonlinear systems, phenomena, and processes. Many applied and engineering problems require dealing with coupled effects which are essential to a better understanding of complex systems behaviour. Appropriate tools to study such systems are based on systems of partial (deterministic and stochastic) differential equations expressing fundamental laws of physics. The workshop will focus on both physical coupling and algorithmic coupling, as well as on hybrid systems where continuous and discrete dynamics have to be treated concurrently. </p>
<p>In many cases coupling requires dealing with interacting components which could be structures, fluids or solid media, while in other cases such interacting components could be given by several different fields such as mechanical and thermal, or electrical and mechanical, invoking a unification of two or more physical theories that have been considered separately before. Some such examples are provided by smart materials and structures technology based on new materials such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectrics, magneto- and electrorheological fluids, and magnetostrictive materials. </p>
<p>We are interested in contributions dealing with modelling, numerical approximation, and analysis of such materials and structures. Many control systems, including those used in smart materials and structures technology, require dealing with coupled effects, and we are interested in contributions related to these issues which include control of distributed parameter systems. Papers on non-engineering applications of coupled systems (e.g., in biology, physics, and life sciences) as well as papers on the mathematical analysis of coupled systems, processes, and phenomena are equally welcome. </p>
<h3>CALL FOR PAPERS</h3>
<p>Contributions to the Workshop on<em> Coupled Problems, Processes, and Phenomena</em> are welcome from mathematicians, scientists, and engineers to discuss new models, analysis, algorithm development, and applications of coupled systems, processes, and phenomena. The duration of each talk invited for the workshop will be 45 minutes. There will be 3 invited speakers presenting 1 hour talks.</p>

<h3>SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP</h3>
<p>Wave phenomena are fundamental to a better understanding of physical and engineering systems. The workshop on<em>Wave Phenomena in Physics and Engineering</em> aims at providing the opportunity to computational scientists,  mathematicians, physicists, and engineers to discuss new models, algorithms, and applications  of wave propagation with the major focus on computational aspects of the associated problems.  In particular, we welcome papers on new models and numerical techniques for computational electronics/optoelectronics problems, multiphysics problems, and modelling wave phenomena in engineering applications.</p>
<p>Focusing on the computational aspects, paper submissions are invited in the following topics of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonlinear wave propagation problems, phase transitions in solids and fluids, wave propagation in dispersive media;</li>
<li>Physical acoustics, piezoelectricity, aeroacoustics, and thermoelasticity;</li>
<li>Modelling wave phenomena in bio-medical engineering, aeronautics and naval engineering applications;</li>
<li>Models of semiconductor physics, including low-dimensional systems and Schrodinger type problems;</li>
<li>Multiscale wave phenomena and models for macroscopic engineering structures, devices, systems, and  computational materials science;</li>
<li>High-order and spectral methods on structured and unstructured grids in computational wave propagation;</li>
<li>Parallel and high-performance algorithms for computational wave propagation problems.</li>
</ul>
