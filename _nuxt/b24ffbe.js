The authors emphasize that after the last stage, it may be necessary to carry out a refinement of the mathematical model that has been used to study the process or phenomenon and to repeat the technological cycle of the computational experiment with the new, refined mathematical model.

The authors explain close connections of the theory of decision making with operations research, and other areas such as cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Operations research is understood as a field developing scientific methods for obtaining optimal solutions which are derived based on mathematical models, optimization, statistics, and algorithms.  Details are provided for a number of situations and classes of problems such as multicriteria problems of mathematical programming, as well as decision making and optimization under uncertainty. In the latter context, the authors explain the Bayesian approach, the connection between a priori and a posteriori probabilities, and provide details of formal structures for decision making.  Measures of sensitivity to parameters and entropy-based concepts are also discussed, as well as the key criteria of decision making, including the minimax, Bayes-Laplace, and Savage criteria, along with auxiliary criteria (Hurwicz,  Hodges-Lehman, Germeyer), and different possible choices of the goal functions. The introduction to the risk analysis is also given, with details on confidence intervals and  prognostic factors. In the context of multicriteria decision-making problems, the application of the Pareto optimal principle is explained and elements of  the theory of fuzzy sets are highlighted.  In terms of algorithms for numerical optimization, both cases of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional problems receive quite a comprehensive treatment in the book. The methodologies considered in the book range from the Monte Carlo to heuristic methodologies such as Nelder-Mead.

Many problems that modern engineers and scientists have to solve can be assisted by numerical experiments.

Today, a close collaboration between engineering disciplines and mathematics is not only useful but also routinely necessary.  An alternative to the numerical experiment sometimes can be based on technological experiments. However, such experiments are usually connected with enormous actual costs and time. Therefore, the methodology of the numerical (computational) experiment more and more penetrates into the modelling of technological processes as well.

The description of numerical solutions of PDEs of the second order is exemplified by elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations.

Such processes are intrinsically interconnected. In this book, a general framework for modelling such processes has been developed. First, a hierarchy of mathematical models is discussed based on  comparing the role of particle collisions with other scattering mechanisms. It is argued that the modelling of transport phenomena in semiconductors can be efficiently carried out via relaxation-time approximations. While the Liouville-type models for the evolution of the position-velocity probability density face serious challenges in their numerical implementations, the introduction of  momentum and energy relaxation times allows us to construct a hierarchy of the models, including kinetic, hydrodynamic, and drift-diffusion types. The latter type of models can be justified rigorously via a Hilbert expansion only for low carrier densities and small electric fields. With further miniaturization and scaling of integrated circuits and their components, this group of models is becoming increasingly inadequate to describe complex non-equilibrium and nonlocal processes in semiconductor plasma. Nevertheless, the solutions to such models can still be useful as initial approximations for the models standing higher in the modelling hierarchy. In this book, the author focuses on quasi-hydrodynamic models which provides a reasonable compromise between kinetic and hydrodynamic types of models. Such models consist of coupled systems of partial differential equations that include the Maxwell-Poisson, continuity, and energy balance equations for particle components of electron-hole plasma. Details of the development of efficient computational approximations to such models are given together with their algorithmic realizations, stability conditions, convergence analysis, and examples. The models considered in this book belong to a wider class of nonlocal models. They can be useful in modelling of superconductor superlattices in acousto- and optoelectronics, as well as in the design of such devices as semiconductor lasers, liquid crystal displays, light-emitting diodes, and thin-film devices, to name just a few.

Such Study Groups represent a forum where academic mathematicians work on problems directly related to the industry. The history of such workshops goes back to 1963 when  the Oxford Study Group with Industry was initiated by Alan Tayler. Later, the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI) was organized and the name of the European Study Group with Industry (ESGI), as an internationally recognized method of technology transfer between academic mathematicians and industry, has started being used. At the ECMI Council meeting in 1997, the decision was made that Study Groups should also be held outside Great Britain, and the 47th European Study Group with Industry in Denmark was one such example.  For the first time, the conference took place in the Sønderborg area. A large number of high-technological companies create growth and dynamics in the area and make the region one of the most important centers for information technology, telecommunication, and electronics in Denmark. Sønderborg is a port, an industrial and commercial center, and a seaside resort. It is a city where the historic past meets the future. During the meeting, five working groups were formed who successfully tackled presented industrial challenges. In particular, industrial projects included  Project 1: Stall Prediction Model (Grundfos), Project 2: Model to Check Distance to Catalog Curve (Grundfos), Project 3: Mathematical Analysis of the Dynamic Flow Characteristic in a Damping Nozzle for a Pressure Transmitter (Danfoss Industrial Controls), Project 4: Trigger Algorithm for Ultrasonic Flow Metering (Danfoss Flow Division), and Project 5: Determination of Distance from a 2D Picture (Unisensor). In conjunction with the meeting a number of talks were presented. Among them, on “Industry & Science Collaborations” by Frands Voss (MCI Director, USD), on “Computational Methods for Estimation in the Presence of Uncertainty” by  H. Thomas Banks (Director of Center for Research in Scientific Computation, North Carolina State University), on “Computational Modelling of Industrial Operations Involving Multi-physics and Multi-scale Processes” by  Mark Cross (Director of the Centre for Numerical Modelling and Process Analysis,  University of Greenwich), and on “Mathematical Models of Hysteresis” by Martin Brokate (Chair of Numerical Mathematics and Control, Technical University of Munich).

In many cases, such mathematical models are being developed as coupled systems of differential/difference and/or integral equations that require efficient computational techniques for their solution. Scientists and technologists working in industry are often unaware of state-of-the-art developments in mathematical modeling that can be directly pertinent to their problems. At the same time, mathematicians are often unable to tackle challenging new applied problems because they lack knowledge of the domain in which the problems arise. This minisymposium demonstrated some of the key mathematical and computational challenges associated with state-of-the-art developments in nano- and bio-technologies, with the emphasis on important representative examples. At the same time, it exposed the more technologically oriented part of the community to the most advanced mathematical and computational techniques currently being developed, encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.

As such, this book will benefit researchers in applied mathematics, as well as physicists and biologists interested in coupled mathematical models and their analysis for physical and biological nanoscale systems that concern applications in biotechnology and medicine, quantum information processing and optoelectronics.","month":null,"pages":"314 pages","isbn":"","created_at":"2020-07-13T05:54:05.990Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T23:16:23.748Z","journal":"Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics Book Series","keywords":null,"shortcode":"EB-36","pdf":"/research/publications/EB-36.pdf","code":"36","searchInfo":"EB-36 Coupled Mathematical Models for Physical and Biological Nanoscale Systems and Their Applications  Luis Bonilla, Efthimios Kaxiras, Roderick Melnik Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics Book Series ","popInfo":null,"link":null,"extraInfo":"<p>ISBN 978-3-319-76598-3</p>","author_order":[],"authors":[41,125,4],"projects":[],"subprojects":[],"news":[]},{"id":53,"title":"Recent Advances in Mathematical and Statistical Methods for Scientific and Engineering Applications","year":"2018","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-99719-3","volume":"259","type":"Book/Editorial","Keywords":null,"abstract":"This book focuses on the recent development of methodologies and computation methods in mathematical and statistical modelling, computational science and applied mathematics.
