The authors assume that the choice of a physical approximation for the given problem as well as the formulation of a mathematical model has already been made. In other words, it is assumed that a mathematical model of the process or phenomenon under consideration has already been constructed. Hence, in this textbook, they focus on the subsequent stages of the computational experiment: (a) design of an efficient numerical method for the solution of the problem (design of a computational algorithm); (b) creating a computer code which implements that method (algorithm); (c) carrying out computations and the analysis of the numerical results obtained. The authors emphasize that after the last stage, it may be necessary to carry out a refinement of the mathematical model that has been used to study the process or phenomenon and to repeat the technological cycle of the computational experiment with the new, refined mathematical model. Each topic presented by the authors is accompanied by computational codes written in FORTRAN.

It provides details of the raise of decision making as a scientific discipline, main concepts of the theory of decision making, formulations of the associated optimization problems, and numerical methods for their solution.  The authors explain close connections of the theory of decision making with operations research, and other areas such as cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Operations research is understood as a field developing scientific methods for obtaining optimal solutions which are derived based on mathematical models, optimization, statistics, and algorithms.  Details are provided for a number of situations and classes of problems such as multicriteria problems of mathematical programming, as well as decision making and optimization under uncertainty. In the latter context, the authors explain the Bayesian approach, the connection between a priori and a posteriori probabilities, and provide details of formal structures for decision making.  Measures of sensitivity to parameters and entropy-based concepts are also discussed, as well as the key criteria of decision making, including the minimax, Bayes-Laplace, and Savage criteria, along with auxiliary criteria (Hurwicz,  Hodges-Lehman, Germeyer), and different possible choices of the goal functions. The introduction to the risk analysis is also given, with details on confidence intervals and  prognostic factors. In the context of multicriteria decision-making problems, the application of the Pareto optimal principle is explained and elements of  the theory of fuzzy sets are highlighted.  In terms of algorithms for numerical optimization, both cases of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional problems receive quite a comprehensive treatment in the book. The methodologies considered in the book range from the Monte Carlo to heuristic methodologies such as Nelder-Mead.  Each corresponding topic is accompanied by a suggested set of exercises, as well as computational codes, some of which can be used for practical problems of interest, e.g. in queuing theory and operations research.

Many problems that modern engineers and scientists have to solve can be assisted by numerical experiments.  This concerns both, the stage of design, when the numerical experiment is carried out on the design objects, and the stage of the analysis of the physics of fundamentally new elements and constructions. Today, a close collaboration between engineering disciplines and mathematics is not only useful but also routinely necessary.  An alternative to the numerical experiment sometimes can be based on technological experiments. However, such experiments are usually connected with enormous actual costs and time. Therefore, the methodology of the numerical (computational) experiment more and more penetrates into the modelling of technological processes as well.  The current book is devoted to some of the foundational blocks of this methodology and includes such important sections of numerical analysis as computational methods of linear algebra and methods of solving nonlinear equations and systems. The book offers a comprehensive treatment of many algorithms, provides details on their advantages and drawbacks, and presents computational codes for solving a series of problems on the computer.

In practical applications, such equations rarely admit analytical solutions.

In the first part of this book, the authors  provide an in-depth treatment of numerical methods for solving  ordinary differential equations (ODEs), including both one-step and multi-step methods. This is followed by an extensive discussion of boundary value problems  for ODEs, including systems of equations. The topic of partial differential equations (PDEs) is presented in the book starting with the first-order equations where the authors provide details on quasi-linear equations, discontinuous solutions, and the method of characteristics.  The reader sees how the method of characteristics is generalized to the systems of questions of the first order.  The description of numerical solutions of PDEs of the second order is exemplified by elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations.

Such processes are intrinsically interconnected. In this book, a general framework for modelling such processes has been developed. First, a hierarchy of mathematical models is discussed based on  comparing the role of particle collisions with other scattering mechanisms. It is argued that the modelling of transport phenomena in semiconductors can be efficiently carried out via relaxation-time approximations. While the Liouville-type models for the evolution of the position-velocity probability density face serious challenges in their numerical implementations, the introduction of  momentum and energy relaxation times allows us to construct a hierarchy of the models, including kinetic, hydrodynamic, and drift-diffusion types. The latter type of models can be justified rigorously via a Hilbert expansion only for low carrier densities and small electric fields. With further miniaturization and scaling of integrated circuits and their components, this group of models is becoming increasingly inadequate to describe complex non-equilibrium and nonlocal processes in semiconductor plasma. Nevertheless, the solutions to such models can still be useful as initial approximations for the models standing higher in the modelling hierarchy. In this book, the author focuses on quasi-hydrodynamic models which provides a reasonable compromise between kinetic and hydrodynamic types of models. Such models consist of coupled systems of partial differential equations that include the Maxwell-Poisson, continuity, and energy balance equations for particle components of electron-hole plasma. Details of the development of efficient computational approximations to such models are given together with their algorithmic realizations, stability conditions, convergence analysis, and examples. The models considered in this book belong to a wider class of nonlocal models. They can be useful in modelling of superconductor superlattices in acousto- and optoelectronics, as well as in the design of such devices as semiconductor lasers, liquid crystal displays, light-emitting diodes, and thin-film devices, to name just a few.

Such Study Groups represent a forum where academic mathematicians work on problems directly related to the industry. The history of such workshops goes back to 1963 when  the Oxford Study Group with Industry was initiated by Alan Tayler. Later, the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI) was organized and the name of the European Study Group with Industry (ESGI), as an internationally recognized method of technology transfer between academic mathematicians and industry, has started being used. At the ECMI Council meeting in 1997, the decision was made that Study Groups should also be held outside Great Britain, and the 47th European Study Group with Industry in Denmark was one such example.  For the first time, the conference took place in the Sønderborg area. A large number of high-technological companies create growth and dynamics in the area and make the region one of the most important centers for information technology, telecommunication, and electronics in Denmark. Sønderborg is a port, an industrial and commercial center, and a seaside resort. It is a city where the historic past meets the future. During the meeting, five working groups were formed who successfully tackled presented industrial challenges. In particular, industrial projects included  Project 1: Stall Prediction Model (Grundfos), Project 2: Model to Check Distance to Catalog Curve (Grundfos), Project 3: Mathematical Analysis of the Dynamic Flow Characteristic in a Damping Nozzle for a Pressure Transmitter (Danfoss Industrial Controls), Project 4: Trigger Algorithm for Ultrasonic Flow Metering (Danfoss Flow Division), and Project 5: Determination of Distance from a 2D Picture (Unisensor). In conjunction with the meeting a number of talks were presented. Among them, on “Industry & Science Collaborations” by Frands Voss (MCI Director, USD), on “Computational Methods for Estimation in the Presence of Uncertainty” by  H. Thomas Banks (Director of Center for Research in Scientific Computation, North Carolina State University), on “Computational Modelling of Industrial Operations Involving Multi-physics and Multi-scale Processes” by  Mark Cross (Director of the Centre for Numerical Modelling and Process Analysis,  University of Greenwich), and on “Mathematical Models of Hysteresis” by Martin Brokate (Chair of Numerical Mathematics and Control, Technical University of Munich).

Scientists and technologists working in industry are often unaware of state-of-the-art developments in mathematical modeling that can be directly pertinent to their problems. At the same time, mathematicians are often unable to tackle challenging new applied problems because they lack knowledge of the domain in which the problems arise. This minisymposium demonstrated some of the key mathematical and computational challenges associated with state-of-the-art developments in nano- and bio-technologies, with the emphasis on important representative examples. At the same time, it exposed the more technologically oriented part of the community to the most advanced mathematical and computational techniques currently being developed, encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.

Section 2 is an introduction to the basics of discretization methods, including finite difference methods and finite volume methods; concepts such as local truncation error, linear stability and modified equation are included; Godunov’s theorem is stated, proved and its implications are discussed. Section 3 contains two approximate Riemann solvers, as applied to the three-dimensional Euler equations, namely HLLC and EVILIN. Section 4 deals with the construction of non-linear (non-oscillatory) numerical methods of the TVD and ENO type, for a scalar conservation law. In Sect. 5 we use the theory developed for scalar equations as a guideline to construct non-linear (quasi non-oscillatory) second-order finite volume schemes for one-dimensional non-linear systems with source terms.

The authors prove a review of some general mathematical models capable of producing this type of waves, and then describe thermoelastic solitons in detail from theoretical and applied points of view.","pages":"4433- 4438","journal":"Encyclopedia of Thermal Stresses","shortcode":"EB-30","pdf":"/research/publications/EB-30.pdf","code":"30","link":null,"extraInfo":"<p>Editor-in-Chief Hetnarski, R., Springer, ISBN: 978-94-007-2738-0</p>","authors":[131,4]},{"id":57,"title":"Transient thermoelastic waves and dynamic problems, generation and propagation","year":"2014","doi":"10.1007/978-94-007-2739-7","volume":"","type":"Book/Editorial","abstract":null,"pages":"6643 pages","journal":"Encyclopedia of Thermal Stresses","shortcode":"EB-31","pdf":"/research/publications/EB-31.pdf","code":"31","link":null,"extraInfo":"<p>Roderick Melnik is the Encyclopedia Section Editor.</p><p><br></p><p>This editorial section on “Transient thermoelastic waves and dynamic problems, generation and propagation” includes the following entries:</p><ol><li>Lamb Waves in Homogeneous Isotropic Thermoelastic Plates by J.

In their efforts to move forward, multidisciplinary research communities have come to a clear understanding that, along with experimental techniques, mathematical modeling and analysis have become crucial to the study, development and application of systems at the nanoscale.\\n\\nThe conference, held at BIRS in autumn 2016, brought together experts from three different communities working in fields where coupled mathematical models for nanoscale and biosystems are especially relevant: mathematicians, physicists (both theorists and experimentalists), and computational scientists, including those dealing with biological nanostructures. Its objectives: summarize the state-of-the-art; identify and prioritize critical problems of major importance that require solutions; analyze existing methodologies; and explore promising approaches to addressing the challenges identified.\\n\\nThe contributions offer up-to-date introductions to a range of topics in nano and biosystems, identify important challenges, assess current methodologies and explore promising approaches.
