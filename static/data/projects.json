All phenomena we observe in Nature are reflections of various forms couplings, e.g. between different physical fields, between different components of a system, or between different systems. A key to our better understanding of such multiscale coupled systems, effects, and phenomena is kept in their rigorous mathematical description. At the same time, due to coupling and multiscale characteristics of these systems, effects, and phenomena, such a description, consisting in the development of adequate mathematical models and methodologies for their solutions, leads to some of the most challenging problems of modern science &amp; engineering.

                "body": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Some of the most important and challenging problems in science and engineering are coupled problems. The coupling is pronounced at three basic levels: </p><ol><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The level of field coupling as it is the case in thermo-elasticity, electro-elasticity and in many other areas of applications</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The level of coupled effects between different parts of the system, and/or</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">The level of coupling between different spatial/spatio-temporal scales at which the natural or man-made system, that is being studied, operates. </li></ol><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This coupling brings to life new phenomena, the phenomena which are not amenable to an adequate description with conventional mathematical models, traditionally developed without accounting for the coupled nature of the problem. An early observation that the coupling in nature plays a profound role was made by Aristotle who noted that \"the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\" The development of coupled mathematical models has an interesting history with one of the first examples attributed to Pierre Simon Laplace who corrected Newton's purely mechanical theory of sound propagation by accounting for thermal field effects. Another important example includes the development of a dynamic model of coupled electro-magnetic interactions by James Clerk Maxwell. At the M3AI\u00ae Lab, we focus on the development of coupled mathematical models for addressing fundamental questions of science and solving new problems in science and engineering. We study coupled phenomena, effects, and processes that are becoming increasingly important in the areas of nano- and bio-nano technologies, in new technologies based on smart materials and structures, biocompatible materials and bio-inspired systems, and in other areas.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><ul><li class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>Dynamic Thermoelasticity (linear and nonlinear models)</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1 ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>\ufeff</u></strong>As noted, early attempts of creating a theory that would describe mechanical and thermal fields as a unified process go back to P. S. Laplace with his&nbsp;ideas of correcting Newton's purely mechanical theory of sound propagation.&nbsp;However, it is only with the advent of the applications where thermal stresses were becoming increasingly important, the dynamic theory of thermoelasticity was put firmly on the map of research in mathematics and mechanics. In particular, an important modern precursor for the development of coupled dynamic thermoelasticity was laid down by the works of V. I. Danilovskaya who studied thermal stress waves generated by boundary in the early 1950-ies. Most of the works in the field were related to the standard displacement-temperature formulation. We noted that in many applied problems it is the stress components, along with the temperature, are the main unknowns to be determined. As a result, we proposed to solve the problem of coupled dynamic thermoelasticity in the stress-temperature formulation [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-8</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-17</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-41</span>&nbsp;]. Based on the Steklov's operator technique combined with the application of the Bramble-Hilbert lemma, we obtained a priori estimates that were dependent on the solution regularity. A general family of operator-difference schemes for the solution of the underlying problems was derived and convergence of such schemes was analyzed in classes of generalized (weak) solutions. Furthermore, a detailed dispersion analysis for such fully coupled problems was carried out and it was shown that the stability conditions for derived schemes can be obtained with the Cayley transform technique [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-41</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1 ql-align-justify\">We have also been contributing to nonlinear coupled dynamic thermoelasticity. Our main interests here were centered around problems describing multiphase solids such as materials with shape memory and phase transformations. In particular, in order to describe low (martensite) and high (austenite) temperature phases in such materials simultaneously and transformations between these phases, we were using the Landau-Devonshire-Ginzbrurg representation of the free energy function, leading to a quintic nonlinearity in the stress-strain constitutive models. Due to this high order nonlinearity and intrinsic coupling between the equations, the resulting problems are at the forefront of challenges in modern applied and computational mathematics. Our works in this field can be divided into a few groups, (A) to (D).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2 ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>(A) - Model Reduction</u>: </strong>We were interested in the analysis of general three-dimensional (3D) models describing phase transformations, focusing on the development efficient procedures for model reductions. We were the first to propose a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-33</span>&nbsp;] (further discussed and exemplified in [<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-93</span>&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems, with additional examples for SMA patches given in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-86</span>&nbsp;]). This original procedure was based on the center manifold theory. This followed immediately by applications of the reduced model where we were able to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-44</span>&nbsp;]. A generalization of the original model and to include hyperbolic heat conduction effects was also obtained and discussed in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-49</span>&nbsp;]. This generalized model can be also treated with the developed model reduction technique in a straightforward manner. Details of the developed theory for center-manifold-based model reduction of general 3D models for phase transformation in the context of materials with memory were provided in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-55</span>&nbsp;]. Our model reduction procedures based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Galerkin projection techniques can be found in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-106</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-141</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\"><strong><u>(B) - Development of Efficient Numerical Methods</u>:&nbsp;</strong>For the first time, conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-53</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-72</span>&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-100</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-107</span>&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-111</span>&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-114</span>&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-82</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-92</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-104</span>&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-101</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\"><strong><u>(C) - Applications</u>:</strong>&nbsp;The development of models and their efficient numerical solutions in this field having in mind specific physical or engineering systems has been an important part of our research too. Materials with shape memory have applications from aerospace engineering to biomechanics and from medical practices to low dimensional nanostructures. We discussed several applications of these materials in engineering and industrial contexts, where they often have to be treated as multiscale coupled dynamic problems [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-74</span>&nbsp;], in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-42</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-69</span>&nbsp;,<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;EJ-91</span>&nbsp;,<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;EJ-92</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-100</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-107</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-111&nbsp;</span>,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-114</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-117</span>]. More on biological and medical applications of materials with memory can be found&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">here</span>.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\"><strong><u>(D) - Optimization and Control</u>: </strong>A new hybrid optimization procedure for the models describing phase transformations in materials with memory was developed and applied in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-118</span>&nbsp;]. The methodology proposed was based on an initial estimate of the global solution by a genetic algorithm, followed by a refined quasi-Newton procedure to locally refine the optimum. By combining the local and global search algorithms, the developed optimization procedure was demonstrated on several examples. To control such multiphase complex systems as materials with shape memory is a difficult task. This task was undertaken in our paper [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-132</span>&nbsp;] in a closely related context of ferroelectric materials. Theoretical issues of complex systems control were discussed in [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-21</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-60</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-129</span>&nbsp;].</li><li class=\"ql-indent-2\">Most recent applications of coupling between thermal and elastic fields have been explored by us in the context of low dimensional nanostructures [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-135</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-138&nbsp;</span>].</li><li><strong><u>Dynamic Electroelasticity and Electromechanical Fields (piezoelectric effects, linear and nonlinear models)</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Practical applications of electroelasticity theory started at least from the discovery&nbsp;in 1880 by the brothers Pierre and Jacques Curie the direct piezoelectric effect, followed a year later by the works of Gabriel Lippmann on the converse piezoelectric effect. This effect is pronounced by the ability of certain materials to generate an electric field in response to applied mechanical strain. The applicability of such materials is surprisingly large, including a multitude of physical and engineering systems (where crystals, certain ceramics, or piezoelectric polymers are in the heart of their functioning), as well as biological systems, ranging from bones and biological tissues to DNA and proteins.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">The original development of mathematical models in the field of piezoelectricity is largely due to Woldemar Voight and his book on crystal physics published in 1910. Despite many applications of dynamic theory of piezoelectricity, the well-posedness and regularity of solutions of underlying mathematical equations remained open until the late 1980ies. We were the first who succeeded to provide a rigorous mathematical proof of such coupled dynamic models' well-posedness and who analyzed the regularity of their solutions [&nbsp;EJ-3&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-5&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-7&nbsp;]. The main summary of the results are given in [&nbsp;EJ-11&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-22&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-24&nbsp;] and [&nbsp;EJ-31&nbsp;] for one- and multi-dimensional cases, respectively. Efficient variational-difference numerical approximations were also developed at that time with a hierarchy of a priori estimates dependent of the regularity of the underlying solution [&nbsp;EJ-1&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-2&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-6&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-13&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-19&nbsp;]. Those early results were the basis for the development a family of variational-difference schemes for the solution of coupled dynamic problems of electroelasticity describing piezoelectric phenomena, a generalization of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition to the case of coupled electroelasticity, obtained by us for the first time, as well as for obtaining&nbsp;a scale of accuracy results for generalized solutions of such problems and convergence theorems [&nbsp;EJ-22&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-24&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-26&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-29&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-31&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-71&nbsp;] . This provided a rigorous mathematical justification for the application of dynamic models coupling electric and mechanical fields and capable of describing piezoelectric phenomena.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">As a result, our later works in this field were focused on the application of such models to important problems in the analysis and modelling of biological systems (e.g., [&nbsp;EJ-99&nbsp;]), as well as of low dimensional nanostructures such as quantum nanowires, dots, carbon nanotubes (e.g., [&nbsp;EJ-90&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-116&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-135&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-136&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-138&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-146&nbsp;]), where coupled electromechanical fields are of crucial importance.</li><li><strong>Thermoelectricity</strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">The essence of thermoelctricity is a coupling between temperature differences and electric voltage. There are several important effects where thermoelectricity plays a key role, namely the&nbsp;Seebeck,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Peltier effect, and the&nbsp;Thomson effects. These thermoelectric effects have a wide range of applications starting from their traditional cooling applications to their applications in nanotechnology. Our original interest in thermoelectricity was due to modelling issues of SMA actuators&nbsp;[&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-42</span>&nbsp;]. Many problems arising in this context lead to multiscale coupled dynamic models [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-74</span>&nbsp;] and we have continuing interest in developing efficient numerical methods for dealing with such models. In particular, our current interest in the topic is due to the importance of thermoelectricity in modelling low dimensional nanostructures [&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-135</span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">EJ-138</span>&nbsp;].</li><li><strong><u>Ferroelectricity and Flexoelectricity</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">In many materials we observe a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. This phenomenon is known as ferroelectricity. To study this phenomenon is difficult due to the fact that its characteristics are dependent on a range of different factors, including dimensions of the material sample, temperature, surface effects and boundary conditions, etc. Landau theory provides a foundation upon which the mathematical modelling of ferroelectric materials is based. Corresponding (thermodynamic) mathematical models, derived from the expansion of the free energy function, serve as a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic modelling frameworks. Due to contributions of Devonshire specifically in the context of ferroelectric and Ginzburg in the context of finite size ferroelectrics, the resulting models are usually termed as the models of Landau-Devonshire-Ginzburg type. It is these models that represent our main interest in this field.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Ferroelectricity is becoming increasingly important at the nanoscale due to its size dependence. We are interested in this and other similar effects at the nanoscale such as flexoelectricity where the material may exhibit a spontaneous electrical polarization induced by a strain gradient. In fact, recent studies show that low dimensional nanostructures may exhibit nonlocal electromechanical effects such as&nbsp;flexoelectricity. At the same time, despite the recent progress in nanostructure growth techniques imperfections such as defects are practically unavoidable. These imperfections may enhance flexoelectric effects. We analyzed the effects of these imperfections on linear electromechanical properties and on&nbsp;flexoelectricity, focusing on the study of GaN-based quantum dots embedded in an AlN matrix [&nbsp;EP-79&nbsp;].</li><li><strong><u>Coupled Dynamic Thermo-electroelasticity, Magneto-thermo-electroelasticity, Other Coupled Effects</u></strong></li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Mathematical models of thermo-electroelasticity and numerical methods for their solutions were studied in [&nbsp;EJ-39&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-56&nbsp;]. The interactions of piezoelectric structures with fluid media as a representative example of fluid-structure interaction problems were studied by us in [&nbsp;EJ-85&nbsp;]. On a closely related note we have also been interested in interactions of electromechanical fields with acoustic media. Such problems are important in many applications in the classical mechanics setting [&nbsp;EJ-50&nbsp;], as well as in the context of modelling opto-electronic media [&nbsp;EJ-14&nbsp;] where quantum effects may become important. The latter is of interest to us in the context of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures where we also analyzed systematically the influence of thermo-electromechanical fields on the properties of such structures [&nbsp;EJ-135&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-138&nbsp;], as well as the influence of the magnetic field as a control parameter [&nbsp;EJ-146&nbsp;].</li></ul><p><br></p>",

This includes our analysis of Goldstone singularity in XY models and the Goldstone mode effects in three-dimensional O(4) models.

However, a major drawback in the application of this algorithm were related to difficulties in its parallelization, in particular in the application to large lattices. On the example of three-dimensional Ising models, in [&nbsp;EJ-142&nbsp;] we demonstrated for the first time how parallelization of the Wolff single cluster algorithm can be achieved. Our procedure is generalizable to other lattice spin models and provides an important new tool for the simulation of very large lattices near the critical phase transition point.</p><p><br></p><p>Phase transformations are universal phenomena occurring frequently in physics and chemistry, biology and medicine, engineering and finance.

As these disciplines are becoming increasingly quantitative, there is a need in the development of mathematical models for a vast variety of processes and phenomena, most of which have (spatial and/or temporal) multiscale characteristics. In a number of cases, our interests in this field lie with going down all the way to the building block of life, where we analyze RNA structures at the nanoscale. We develop mathematical models for such building blocks as well as for other biomolecules. Recall that the size of folded RNA structures, for example, is often measured by using the radius of gyration as being on the order of C N&nbsp;</span><sup style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1/3&nbsp;</sup><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\u00c5, according to the Flory scaling law, with N being the number of nucleotides and certain constant C. RNA molecules that encode a specific protein product are known as messengers of RNA or mRNA. Although mRNA vary substantially in their size, it is fair to say that most proteins contain at least a hundred amino acid residues and that mRNA must have at least 300 nucleotides on the basis of the triplet code (100 x 3). This gives us certain ideas on the relative size of these molecules. The specific structures we are analyzing are known as RNA nanostructures. These building blocks in their symmetric versions have spatial dimensions lying in the range of 10 - 20 nm. In our research in this focus area we analyze objects from the nanoscale to meso- and to macro- scales. In addition to RNA nanostructures, we are also interested in a number of other areas of mathematical modeling in biology and medicine, including the dynamics of cell cycles, relaxation processes of DNA molecules, biomedical devices with smart materials, biological imaging, drug delivery techniques.\ufeff</span></p><ul><li>Computational neuroscience and brain research; Models for chronic pain management;</li><li>Biological cells, cellular organelles,and microtubules; coupled and nonlocal effects;</li><li>Biological tissues under thermal ablation, neural and cardiovascular systems; relaxation time effects;</li><li>Mathematical models for drug delivery and other biomedical applications;</li><li>RNA nanostructures; multiple scales in life science and medicine; DNA modeling and dynamics of biomolecules; RNA interference/silencing; cell dynamics;</li><li>Imaging in biology and medicine, the use of quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, bionanotechnology;</li><li>Structurally inhomogeneous systems, biomechanics, bilogical networks.</li></ul>",

We analyzed several systems for drug delivery, including the pulmonary-drug-delivery-mode systems based on air-blast atomization which are very important for successful pharmacotherapy. In the heart of such medical systems operation lies the Venturi effect where we observe the reduction in fluid pressure as a result of a fluid flows through a geometrically confined section of a Venturi tube. A conservation-law-based mathematical model was developed and key control parameters, that can allow improvement in the efficiency of the system, were identified [ EJ-47 ]. Main characteristics of the system were analyzed numerically as functions or these parameters.</p><p><br></p><p>Other biomedical and biomechanical applications of interest include the development of mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for their solutions for the usage of smart materials. Materials such as shape memory alloys find a wide range of applications in orthodontics and dental biomechanics , optometry, orthopedic surgery, biologically-friendly replacements in body cavities, arteries and other vascular applications, implants, and in various surgery instruments. While there exists a vast amount of literature on constitutive and time-independent modelling of SMAs and SMA-based systems, our main focus over the years has been of the dynamics. This is quite important feature in biological and medical applications of SMAs. Two key technologies are related to this: smart materials and structures technology and nondestructive evaluation technology. The latter includes the development of non-invasive (or less invasive) medical diagnostics. We first proposed a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [ EJ-33 ] (further discussed in [EJ-93 ] for both uncoupled and coupled problems). This allowed to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [ EJ-44 ], with further generalization to include hyperbolicity of heat conduction to follow [ EJ-49 ]. Conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [ EJ-53 , EJ-72 ]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [ EJ-100 , EJ-107 ] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [ EJ-111 ]. A new hybrid optimization procedure was developed and applied in [ EJ-118 ]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [ EJ-114 ]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [ EJ-82 , EJ-92 , EJ-104 ] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [ EJ-101 ]. We have also developed several efficient procedures for model reductions in this field based on the manifold reduction, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and the Galerkin projection techniques [ EJ-33 , EJ-55 , EJ-106 , EJ-141 ]. More details on our research into the dynamics of SMAs and SMA-based devices can be found here.</p><p><br></p><p>While pulmonary and injection modes of drug delivery have remained their leading positions over the years, it has been recognized that new biological drugs, in particular those based on proteins and nucleic acids that promise to minimize side effects, require new delivery technologies. Indeed, the success of widely discussed RNA and DNA therapies is essentially dependent on such technologies. A key technology to have a revolutionary impact on this field is nanotechnology, a technology that leads a way to the development of efficient nansocale drug delivery techniques. Nanotechnology-based drug carriers have enormous potential in both, the delivery of small molecules and the delivery of such large biomolecules as proteins and nucleic acids to specific targeted areas within the body. Our focus in this area of nanomedicine is on RNA nanostructures as structures that have substantial potential in the development of these new techniques as well as in other areas of biomedical sciences. Nevertheless, very little is known about these structures and our efforts of our group have been directed towards a better understanding of of RNA nanostructure properties [ EJ-137 ]. Several new phenomena have been discovered, including the phenomenon of self-stabilisation of such RNA nanostructures. A hierarchy of new models for systematic studies of such structures have been developed in [ EJ-145 ].</p><p><br></p><p>Other nanostructure-mediated drug delivery methods include quantum dots/shells and carbone nanotubes.

These essential building and functional blocks of life, along with three other main components, proteins, glycans and lipids, consist of molecules which in their turn consist of certain elements. Most of life forms on this planet are made of four basic elements (made of only one type of atom): carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. DNA, for example, has four nitrogen-containing bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA molecules form genes found on chromosomes, and genetic frequencies in a population gives us a clue to evolution. It is believed that DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) which is translated into amino acids. While DNA is a double-stranded biomolecule, RNA is single-stranded such that its messenger (mRNA) carries all instructions from the nucleus to all places where they are needed throughout the cell.</p><p><br></p><p>Our interests here include a range of multiscale problems such as cell dynamics, in particular under the influence of unexpected events or fluctuations [ EJ -130 ], as well as the dynamics of DNA biomolecules where we carried out the analysis of their relaxation under different conditions [ EJ-105 , EJ-109 ]. Several models were constructed for this purpose where an important component was the Smoluchowski equation. In terms of RNA, we are interested in RNA silencing phenomena and technologies associated with them [ EP-67 ], as well as in studying RNA nanostructures where we succeeded to make important steps towards a better understanding of these structures' properties [ EJ-137 , EJ-145 ].

We developed a new model for this phenomenon, as well as an efficient method for its numerical solution, and presented results on thermal spiking on an example of bone cement [&nbsp;EJ-45&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-59&nbsp;]. We showed that mathematically such problems are reducible to a coupled system of ODEs and PDE. Other authors used such mixed coupled models for other biological and medical applications, e.g. in vascular remodelling in biological tissues. The techniques we developed may proved to be quite useful in a number of other areas too. Our other works on polymers and composite materials included the development of efficient algorithms for initial topological optimization of complex polymeric and composite systems [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;], hyperbolic time relaxation models for polymeric materials [&nbsp;EJ-78&nbsp;], relaxation of DNA and the influence of internal viscosity in associated problems [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>Many systems that we have to deal with in this focus areas are characterized by complex dynamic behaviour as well as by coupled multiscale spatial interactions. An important example is provided by nonlinear thermoelasticity which has an increasing range of applications in life sciences in general and in biomechanics in particular. A number of our contributions were devoted to the development of mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for dynamic problems in bio-inspired materials such as shape memory alloys (SMAs). These materials find a wide range of applications in orthodontics and dental biomechanics , optometry, orthopedic surgery, biologically-friendly replacements in body cavities, arteries and other vascular applications, implants, and in various surgery instruments. While there exists a vast amount of literature on constitutive and time-independent modelling of SMAs and SMA-based systems, our main focus over the years has been of the dynamics. This is quite important feature in biological and medical applications of SMAs. Two key technologies are related to this: smart materials and structures technology and nondestructive evaluation technology. The latter includes&nbsp;the development of non-invasive (or less invasive) medical diagnostics.&nbsp;We first proposed a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;] (further discussed in [EJ-93&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems). This allowed to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;EJ-44&nbsp;], with further generalization to include hyperbolicity of heat conduction to follow [&nbsp;EJ-49&nbsp;]. Conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;EJ-53&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-72&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;EJ-100&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-107&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;EJ-111&nbsp;]. A new hybrid optimization procedure was developed and applied in [&nbsp;EJ-118&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;EJ-114&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-82&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-92&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-104&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;EJ-101&nbsp;].

Further development of these ideas led to a hierarchy of mathematical models for cell cycle dynamics accounting for stochastic fluctuations [&nbsp;EJ-130&nbsp;]. The multiscale character of evolutionary problems and an intrinsic link between microscopic and macroscopic models for evolution via the concept of perturbed generalized dynamic systems has been discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-120&nbsp;].&nbsp;This concept has other potential applications ranging from control [&nbsp;EJ-21&nbsp;]to the development of evolutionary algorithms in different areas of science, engineering, and even finance [ EP-T-2010], and to the analysis of complex networks.</p><p><br></p><p>Coupled effects are of crucial importance in studying proteins and biological systems that contain proteins.

Such boundary conditions were derived and discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-75&nbsp;]. Multiscale systems of quantum dots with wetting layers were analyzed in [&nbsp;EJ-65&nbsp;] for different geometries of quantum dots and the results of band structure calculations were systematically compared (also proceedings [&nbsp;EP-25&nbsp;] where cylindrical quantum dots with wetting layers were analyzed in detail).</p><p><br></p><p>In what follows, we briefly describe our results on the development and applications of mathematical models for the analysis of low dimensional nanostructures, focusing first on quantum dots, rods, nanowires, and nanowire superlattices, and then moving to quantum dot arrays.</p><p><br></p><p>By using the multiband theory, we demonstrated the universality of the phenomenon of inversion, showed its existence for the exited states, and provided a guidelines for the prediction of barrier localization in modulated nanowires.

We analyzed the resulting mathematical model showed that a failure to restrict the Fourier expansion coefficients of the envelope function to small k components would lead to the appearance of non-physical solutions. We proposed a simple and effective solution to the problem and demonstrated it on an example of a two-band model for both bulk materials and low-dimensional nanostructures.

In addition to a comprehensive comparison of two- and three- dimensional models, accounting for anisotropy and piezoelectricity, we also presented the results on the effects of the finite length of the nanowires on electromechanical field distributions.

It was pointed out that the influence of strain effects is typically analyzed with simplified linear models based on the minimization of uncoupled, purely elastic energy functionals with respect to displacements . The applicability of such models is limited to the study of isolated idealized quantum dots, and both coupled and nonlinear effects need to be accounted for in the analysis of more realistic structures. In this paper, generalizations of the existing models for bandstructure calculations are discussed in the context of strain effects. Exemplifications are given for hexagonal wurtzite semiconductor nanostructures.

New efficient algorithms for such an optimization were discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;] based on several distance geometry ideas.&nbsp;Another example includes multiphase materials where we proposed and applied&nbsp;a new hybrid optimization procedure in the context of shape memory materials [&nbsp;EJ-118&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>We are also interested in control of complex systems. In particular, in [&nbsp;EJ-60&nbsp;] in the context of control theory we analyzed in detail a theoretical framework for deterministic and stochastic dynamics with hyperbolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. It was proposed to approximate the original controlled dynamics with a sequence of PDEs. By applying the Steklov-Poincare operator technique the general form of equations in such a sequence was established. In [&nbsp;EJ-21&nbsp;] we dealt with nonsmooth optimal control problems in the case when the control was allowed to be a discontinuous function. We analysed smoothness assumptions on an adjoint process in deterministic and stochastic cases. Possibilities of steep generalized space-gradients of the adjoint function implied the necessity of an approximation of the Hamiltonian. The key question of such an approximation is a relationship between the control and the value function. Under quite general assumptions it was proved that the performance measure for the original process is determined by the control function with possible discontinuities. Many complex systems operate under the presence of uncertainty which may include human factors. It is known that with the increasing complexity of technological systems that operate in dynamically changing environments and require human supervision or a human operator, the relative share of human errors is increasing across all modern applications. This indicates that in the analysis and control of such systems, human factors should not be eliminated by conventional formal mathematical methodologies.

In the study of cell cycles, nonlinear phenomena play a paramount role, in particular in those cases where the cellular dynamics is in the focus of attention. Quantification of this dynamics is a challenging task due to a wide range of parameters that require estimations and the presence of many stochastic effects. Based on the originally deterministic model, in [&nbsp;EJ-130&nbsp;] we developed a hierarchy of models that allow us to describe the nonlinear dynamics accounting for special events of cell cycles. We considered the influence of stochasticity in the analysis of cell cycle dynamics by accounting fluctuations of relative concentrations of proteins during special events of cell cycles and demonstrated that the metabolic events in gene regulatory networks can qualitatively influence the dynamics of the cell cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>Most interesting problems in biological, environmental and materials sciences are multiscale with a range of spatial and temporal scales as discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;]. In solving such problems with atomistic and Molecular Dynamics (MD) tools, an initial topological optimization can lead to a substantial speed up of subsequent computations. New efficient algorithms for such an optimization were discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;] based on several distance geometry ideas. In applying MD tools, we often have to choose between different schemes of stochastic thermostats, e.g. Langevin, Berendsen, etc in such a way that the `fluctuation-dissipation' theorem is obeyed to guarantee the chosen statistics. These tools provide a powerful technique for the analysis of complex biological structures. In [&nbsp;EJ-137&nbsp;] we applied these tools for the analysis of RNA nanostructures where we discovered a phenomenon of self-stabilization. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been proposed as a promising alternative to DNA and proteins for the design of the artificial self-assembled materials at nanoscale (e.g. [1] and references therein). As compared to DNA and some other bio-molecules, RNA offers not only a much greater variety of interactions but also such an important feature as great conformational flexibility of RNA structures. This feature is used by Nature via the ubiquitous catalytic function of RNA, and now it also makes RNA a very promising functional nano-material for the design of the man-made molecular devices and systems. We presented several promising multiscale methodologies for simulation of such biomolecular systems as RNA nanostructures, focusing on the development of a hierarchy of simplified coarse-grained mesoscopic models suitable for the description of such biological nanostructures and details of this can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-145&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>The coarse-graining approach is one of the most important modeling methods in research of long-chain polymers such as DNA molecules.&nbsp;We applied several such models for the analysis of polymeric fluids and relaxation of DNA bio-molecules [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;]. We analyzed the behavour of these systems under different shear rates [&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;], extensional flows [&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;], and provided new results of Brownian dynamics simulations of single DNA molecules in shear flows taking into account the effect of internal viscosity [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;] where our model included the Smoluchowski equation.</p><p>Climate systems models have been discussed by us earlier in&nbsp;[&nbsp;EJ-23&nbsp;]&nbsp;with the error analysis discussion found in[&nbsp;EP-3&nbsp;].

It is very important to be able to predict such exponents with a sufficient degree of accuracy in a range of physically relevant situations.

The Wolff cluster algorithm provides one of the most effective tools to simulate important properties of many particle systems near the critical point. However, a major drawback in the application of this algorithm were related to difficulties in its parallelization, in particular in the application to large lattices. On the example of three-dimensional Ising models, in [&nbsp;EJ-142&nbsp;] we demonstrated for the first time how parallelization of the Wolff single cluster algorithm can be achieved. Our procedure is generalizable to other lattice spin models and provides an important new tool for the simulation of very large lattices near the critical phase transition point.</p>",

Mathematically, FPT problem can be reduced to estimating the probability of a stochastic process first to reach a boundary level. In most important applications in the financial industry, the FPT problem does not have an analytical solution and the development of efficient numerical methods becomes the only practical avenue for its solution.&nbsp;We developed a fast Monte Carlo method in the case of multivariate (and correlated) jump-diffusion processes&nbsp;( JDP).

By applying the Steklov-Poincare operator technique the general form of equations in such a sequence was established. In [&nbsp;EJ-21&nbsp;] we dealt with nonsmooth optimal control problems in the case when the control was allowed to be a discontinuous function. We analyzed smoothness assumptions on an adjoint process in deterministic and stochastic cases. Possibilities of steep generalized space-gradients of the adjoint function implied the necessity of an approximation of the Hamiltonian. The key question of such an approximation is a relationship between the control and the value function.

In many ways, the class of problems in bio-nanotechnology we are interested in has been motivated by our interest in multiscale mathematical problems in biology, medicine, and nanotechnology. Details of this are given in the&nbsp;next section&nbsp;and&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Sensors and actuators are key elements for humans and for human-made systems to interact with our environment. Many sensors and actuators are designed based on smart materials and in this sense these two technologies are not independent. Furthermore, due to a trend of reducing the size of sensors and actuators, in many applications nanotechnology plays an increasingly important role in this field. These technologies (separately or in their combination) have opened opportunities for nondestructive testing which includes a range of methodologies from ultrasonic to electromagnetic and to optic methods.&nbsp;In a nutshell (and apart from nanotechnological issues which are discussed separately&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.m2netlab.wlu.ca/research/mathematics-nano-science.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), our interest in this diverse field focuses on piezoelectric and shape memory materials (SMA) and devices, but include also other smart (intelligent, adaptive) materials such as electroactive polymers and ferroelectrics, as well as thermoelectrics and other materials and devices based on these materials. Some of the publications on thermoelectric SMA actuators and shape memory alloys in engineering and industrial context can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-42&nbsp;] and [&nbsp;EJ-69&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-91&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-92&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-100&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-111&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-114&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-117&nbsp;], respectively (with a more detailed account on these and other coupled problems found&nbsp;here&nbsp;and in a number of special journal issues, including [&nbsp;EJ-68&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-84&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-88&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-97&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-113&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-121&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-124&nbsp;]).</p><p><br></p><p>Thermal analysis of complex systems in industrial applications, developing mathematical models and numerical discretization for such an analysis, has been a topic of continuing interest, covering nonlinear mathematical models for thermal analysis of integrated circuits in semiconductor industry [&nbsp;EJ-12&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-16&nbsp;] as well as mathematical models for thermal analysis of electric induction motors [&nbsp;EJ-52&nbsp;]. We also developed a new model and numerical approximation to analyze the effect of the presence of molecular water impurity of various concentrations in absorbing and scattering glass media on the temperature field in a layer subjected to thermal infrared radiation [&nbsp;EJ-77&nbsp;]. Our contributions to the development of efficient numerical procedures for energy balance models are found in [&nbsp;EJ-20&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-30&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-32&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-37&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-51&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-70&nbsp;] . Such models are able to account for non-local, non-equilibrium processes and have a wide range of applicability. We demonstrated the efficiency of the developed models and their numerical approximations in describing important phenomena in semiconductor plasma, including velocity overshoot, fast photo-response of optically sensitive semiconductors for photonics applications and others. Our contributions to modelling complex systems&nbsp;for renewable and alternative sources of energy&nbsp;can be found&nbsp;here, while more details on applied coupled problems of industrial interest, including thermoelasticity, electroelasticity and others, can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>The dynamic behaviour of ferroelectric materials and multilayer structures is an important component of many current and potential applications. Mathematically, associated mathematical models are strongly nonlinear and represent substantial challenges for the analysis and the development of efficient numerical techniques. By symmetry considerations, most ferroelectric materials are also piezoelectric and pyroelectric which make them very useful as capacitors in sensor applications, among many others. We developed an efficient model for the analysis of these materials, as well as numerical procedures to carry out such an analysis, and some cases their control [&nbsp;EJ-127&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-132&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-141].</p><p>The analysis of thermo-piezoelectric coupling was carried out in [&nbsp;EJ-39&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-56&nbsp;] and the full coupling between a piezoelectric structure and gas/fluid media has been analyzed by us in [&nbsp;EJ-50&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-85&nbsp;] where we also discussed the solution methodology for such coupled problems.</p><p>The importance of and trends in interdisciplinary education were discussed in our contribution [&nbsp;EJ-57&nbsp;] where we proposed core curriculum subjects for university departments specializing in or with a strong component of applied mathematics and mathematical modelling, reflecting interdisciplinary challenges that must be part of new educational practices .</p><p>Several special journals issues appeared where many challenging problems of industrial and engineering mathematics can be found along with state-of-the-art tools for their solutions [&nbsp;EJ-68&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-88&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-97&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-113&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-121&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-124&nbsp;].</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

                "body": "<p>We analyzed several systems for drug delivery [&nbsp;EJ-47&nbsp;] and looked into novel potential applications of RNA nanostructures in medical sciences, focusing on studying their properties [&nbsp;EJ-137&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-145&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>We contributed to the development of mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for dynamic problems in bio-inspired materials such as shape memory alloys (SMAs). These materials find a wide range of applications in orthodontics and dental biomechanics , optometry, orthopedic surgery, biologically-friendly replacements in body cavities, arteries and other vascular applications, implants, and in various surgery instruments. While there exists a vast amount of literature on constitutive and time-independent modelling of SMAs and SMA-based systems, our main focus over the years has been of the dynamics. This is quite important feature in biological and medical applications of SMAs. Two key technologies are related to this: smart materials and structures technology and nondestructive evaluation technology. The latter includes&nbsp;the development of non-invasive (or less invasive) medical diagnostics.&nbsp;We first proposed a reduction of the full 3D PDE-based models for materials with shape memory to a more tractable differential-algebraic systems [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;] (further discussed in [&nbsp;EJ-93&nbsp;] for both uncoupled and coupled problems). This allowed to treat both stress-induced and temperature-induced phase transformations in these materials and related hysteresis phenomena in a unified manner [&nbsp;EJ-44&nbsp;], with further generalization to include hyperbolicity of heat conduction to follow [&nbsp;EJ-49&nbsp;]. Conservative numerical approximations in this field of dynamic problems were developed and justified mathematically in [&nbsp;EJ-53&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-72&nbsp;]. Chebyshev's collocation and Chebyshev's spectral procedures were developed for these problems in [&nbsp;EJ-100&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-107&nbsp;] (also proceedings [ Cruz-2009 ]) which also included the Rayleigh dissipation term [&nbsp;EJ-111&nbsp;]. A new hybrid optimization procedure was developed and applied in [&nbsp;EJ-118&nbsp;]. We developed a Finite Element Method (FEM) based approach that incorporates the lattice kinetics, involving the order variables, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [&nbsp;EJ-114&nbsp;]. Its variants, including those applied to 3D problems, were discussed in detail in [&nbsp;EJ-82&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-92&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-104&nbsp;] and our new Finite Volume Method procedure for these dynamic problems was reported in [&nbsp;EJ-101&nbsp;]. We have also developed several efficient procedures for model reductions in this field based on the manifold reduction, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and the Galerkin projection techniques [&nbsp;EJ-33&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-55&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-106&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-141&nbsp;]. More details on our research into the dynamics of SMAs and SMA-based devices can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Polymers and composites are another class of materials that find numerous important applications in medical and biological science. Some of our contributions to this field can be found in [&nbsp;EJ-58&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-78&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-126&nbsp;]. We note that that in polymeric materials applied in medical applications there are many non-trivial phenomena that need to be understood much better. We initiated the analysis of one such phenomena known as thermal spiking. We developed a new model for this phenomenon, as well as an efficient method for its numerical solution, and presented results on thermal spiking on an example of bone cement [&nbsp;EJ-45&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-59]. We showed that mathematically such problems are reducible to a coupled system of ODEs and PDE. Other authors used such mixed coupled models for other biological and medical applications, e.g. in vascular remodelling in biological tissues. The techniques we developed may proved to be quite useful in those areas too.</p><p><br></p><p>In the context of environmental sciences, we analyzed models for climate systems [&nbsp;EJ-23&nbsp;] (also proceedings [&nbsp;EP-3&nbsp;]). Climate belongs to the class of systems whose dynamics are only observable in transient states and the resulting mathematical models are characterized by the fact that small-scale phenomena influence the large-scale properties of the modelling system (with the former that cannot be extracted from the latter using available hardware and computational procedures). We provided arguments for such models to be treated as a link between coupled physical processes and computational decoupling with subsequent implications to further climate predictions.</p><p><br></p><p>Our contributions to the development of mathematical models for renewable and alternative sources of energy are described&nbsp;here.</p><p>We are interested in the development of mathematical models for biological and chemical sensors (including those can be used in harsh environments for environmental monitoring), as well as for the field emission as an alternative to the conventional X-ray radiation. In particular, we proposed a series of new multiscale multi-physics models for the evolution of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) on thin films, numerical methods for the solution of the resulting problems, and we reported the efficiency of the proposed models and techniques based on theoretical, computational, and experimental results [&nbsp;EJ-112&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-116&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-122&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-131&nbsp;].</p><p><br></p><p>We developed mathematical models and efficient numerical methods for their solutions for studying the effect of thermal damage induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers [&nbsp;EJ-89&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-96&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-119&nbsp;]. Apart from applications in physics, chemistry, and engineering, this research is increasingly important in biology and medicine in the context of preventing thermal damage of human tissues.</p><p><br></p><p>Piezoeffect in biological tissues has been a subject of long standing interest and controversies. We analyzed this effect in a dynamic setting accounting for the hydration effect in human cornea [&nbsp;EJ-99&nbsp;]. Other problems of piezoelectricity, including the issues of existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions for the corresponding time-dependent mathematical models can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p><br></p><p>Several models for the analysis of relaxation of DNA molecules were proposed in [&nbsp;EJ-105&nbsp;,&nbsp;EJ-109&nbsp;] and more information about our research in these areas can be found&nbsp;here. These include also RNA silencing phenomena [&nbsp;EP-67&nbsp;], modelling genetic networks as a multiscale process [&nbsp;EP-37&nbsp;], and the analysis of cell cycle dynamics [&nbsp;EJ -130&nbsp;].</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
