Based on the derived law of conservation of energy of an electromechanical system and its difference analogue, a second-order variational-type difference scheme has been constructed by using the method of approximation of quadratic functionals. The variational difference scheme, obtained with the proposed methodology, provides a way to conserve the properties of the original dynamic differential model on the grid. ",

    "abstract": "When formulating mathematical models for many problems in electronics, such as for the analysis of thermal conditions of integrated circuits (IC), we often have to deal with situations where relaxed regularity assumptions on the a priori unknown solutions are required. Indeed, in the analysis of IC thermal conditions, thermal characteristics of elements located on the curcuit are usually different. Another challenge in mathematical electronics lies with the fact that we often have to deal with multi-dimensional mathematical models and therefore the development of efficient numerical approximations for such models in this field is essential. The method of summary approximation provides a way to develop such approximations. It allows us to reduce the problem to additive difference schemes, or more generally to additive vector schemes, for both steady-state and time-dependent problems with general types of boundary conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method in the context of problems of thermal management of ICs.",

    "abstract": "Thermal conditions of integrated microcircuits play a fundamental role in developing more reliable electronic components and devices. The well-known problem of \"self-heating\" of electronic components and devices leads to serious limitations of a degree of integration of electronic elements on the substrate. As a result, IC thermal conditions will largely determine further progress in the field of electronics. Mathematically, problems of determing thermal conditions of integrated circuits can be reduced to solving partial differential equations. In this contribution, we show how to decrease the number of iterations for achieving a pre-defined accuracy in typical problems of calculating IC thermal conditions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed mathematical model, developed under the assumption of smallness of the substrate thickness compared to its geometric dimensions in the topology plane, can effectively take into account different practical ways of IC substrate mounting in electronic applications.

With the use of the Faedo-Galerkin method, the existence, uniqueness and regularity of generalized solutions to the corresponding initial-boundary value problem have all been proved.

This problem arises in many applications and typical examples include situations where such media consist of different material layers, e.g. piezodielectric-semiconductor, semiconductor-dielectric, etc. In this paper, two mathematical formulations of this problem have been analysed in detail, namely the formulation in deformation and the formulation in displacement. For the numerical solution of the problem, explicit difference schemes have been constructed and their stability conditions have been derived. ",

The key question of such an approximation is a relationship between the control and the value function.

These models are characterized by the fact that small-scale phenomena influence the large-scale properties of the modelling system, yet the former cannot be extracted from the latter using available hardware and computational procedures. Climate systems belong to the class of systems whose dynamics are only observable in transient states. As a result, the sensitivity of models to coupling procedures requires an examination of the schemes responsible for transporting data between components. It is proposed to perform such an examination, based on the connection between error growth and the degree of coupling of model components, using adaptive error control.",

Larger values of the relaxation time are shown to result in smoother temperature profiles. The dynamics generated by a localised heat release from an external source is studied. It is observed that the source excites a standing-like wave of the displacement while temperature monotonically decays.",

Such elements (and the associated models allowing computations of their dynamics under different thermo-electromechanical loading conditions) become increasingly important not only in the traditional applications of piezoelectrics such as piezotransducers, but also in the context of smart materials and structures applications. Based on the variational approach and theory of generalized solutions efficient numerical schemes for a fully coupled model have been developed.

For such situations we have developed an efficient explicit numerical methodology allowing us to compute dynamic electromechanical characteristics of piezoelectric structures and devices under various loading conditions. We show that the stability conditions for our numerical approximation can be obtained from a discrete conservation law, and be cast in a form similar to that of the classical CFL condition. However, in our case the velocities of wave propagation, participating in the formulation of the stability conditions, are clearly dependent on the pattern of electromechanical coupling. Our discussion here is centered around finite piezoelectric shells of cylindrical shape and we present several results of computational experiments where both weak and strong couplings are discussed.

    "abstract": "In developing electric machines in general, and induction motors in particular, temperature limits is a key factor affecting the efficiency of the overall design. Since conventional loading of induction motors is often expensive, the estimation of temperature rise by tools of mathematical modelling and computational experiments becomes increasingly important. In the present paper we develop and validate experimentally a model accounting for losses and describing thermal phenomena in induction motors. The developed model has been implemented in FEMLAB, and has been applied to predict temperature rise in totally enclosed fan-cooled induction motors. Comparisons with experimental results obtained with a 1.5 kW standard squirrel-cage induction motor show the effectiveness of the developed model in predicting temperature rise for a range of operating conditions, in particular for different frequencies and voltages. Finally, a SIMULINK-based control loop has been developed by using the thermal model as an input.",

Despite their predominant use in the literature, linear approximations of such curves may fail to predict correctly key characteristics of vehicle performance efficiency such as torque-speed profiles. Although attempts to model these characteristics in the context of slip phenomena have been made before, to our best knowledge a general model with respect to the vehicle velocity, the wheel rotating velocity, the slip ratio, the traction force, and the torque, has never been formulated and solved as a coupled nonlinear problem based on a system of differential-algebraic equations arising naturally in this context. In this paper, such a model is formulated, solved numerically, and some results of numerical simulation of driving an electric vehicle on different surface conditions are presented.",

One of the major processing techniques for producing such structures is the curing process. This process may be accompanied by undesirable thermal spiking phenomena during which the released energy may be trapped inside of the structure. In order to predict the onset of this phenomenon models that couple reaction kinetics and heat transfer are required. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for the solution of such coupled problems. The algorithm is based on the alternating-triangular methodology which is more efficient compared to ADI methodologies conventionally applied to similar problems. The algorithm is described in detail. The results for simulations of reaction kinetics are compared with those obtained in the literature from experimental measurements. A series of numerical experiments for the fully coupled system are also presented.",

These objects are already grown experimentally in laboratories and studies of their properties represent an important task in nanotechnology research. Tools of mathematical modelling provide a powerful means for studying these fascinating structures with an ultimate goal of predicting their properties and understanding their limits. In this paper, we analyse finite nanowire GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As superlattice structures with a cylindrical cross-section and determine their electronic eigenstates and energy eigenvalues. We analyse in detail the qualitative differences, in terms of wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues, between structures containing the same number of barriers and wells (asymmetrical) and structures where the number of barrier layers is one above the number of well layers (symmetrical). We demonstrate that asymmetrical NWSL structures have well-pronounced qualitative and quantitative differences as compared to both symmetrical NWSL structures and infinite periodic NWSL structures. We show also that there exists a critical radius R-c for quantum confinement, that is the NWSL ground state is confined in GaAs (Al0.3Ga0.7As) for a nanowire of radius R above (below) R-c. In the specific case where R = R-c, the ground state is smeared out over the entire NWSL structure.",

In this paper QD nanostructures are analysed with due account for coupling effects between electronic states in the dot and the wetting layer regions. The analysis, performed on the basis of the finite element methodology and Arnoldi iterations, demonstrates that the effect of coupling may be essential.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we give a complete description of efficient formulae for the numerical integration of fast oscillating functions of two variables. The focus is on the case encountered frequently in many engineering applications where an accurate value of the Lipschitz constant is not available. Using spline approximations, we demonstrate the main idea of our approach on the example of piecewise bilinear interpolation, and propose optimal-by-order (with a constant not exceeding two) cubature formulae that are applicable for a wide range of oscillatory patterns. This property makes the formulae indispensable in many engineering applications dealing with signal processing and image recognition. Illustrative results of numerical experiments are presented.",

The model is not amenable to analytical treatments and the development, analysis, and applications of effective numerical approximations for this model is in the focus of the present paper. In particular, we discuss a recently proposed fully conservative difference scheme for the solution of the problem. We note that a standard energy inequality technique, applied to the analysis of convergence properties of the scheme, would lead to restrictive assumptions on the grid size and/or excessive smoothness assumptions on the unknown solution. We show how such assumptions can be removed to achieve unconditional convergence of the proposed scheme. Next, we apply the proposed scheme to the analysis of behaviour of a shape memory alloy rod. We demonstrate that the proposed approximation can describe a complete range of behaviour of the shape memory material, including quasiplastic, pseudoelastic, and almost elastic regimes. We discuss the influence of nonlinear effects in each of these regimes focusing on hysteresis effects.",

From a mathematical point of view, the problem in hand is a coupled dynamic system of partial differential equations which is not amenable to analytical treatments and requires an efficient computational tool for its solution. The developed methodology is based on a combination of the analysis of such invariant sets that keep the essentials of the system dynamics and on the reduction procedures of the original model on such sets. A presented numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the developed tool in describing phase transformations in actuators based on materials with shape memory effects.",

    "abstract": "The influence of wetting-layer states on quantum-dot states and vice versa is analysed numerically for electrons in the conduction band in the general case with arbitrary kinetic energy in the plane of the quantum-well wetting layer. Since the analysed quantum dot is embedded in a barrier material with different properties, the effective mass approximation methodology leads to a Schrodinger model with discontinuous coefficients. This complicates the analysis and, in addition, requires a special attention to the formulation of boundary conditions for the entire structure, consisting of the quantum dot with wetting layer embedded in a barrier material. In the present paper, the complete model is formulated and solved numerically via a variational approach based on finite element approximations and Arnoldi iterations. By analysing different geometrical configurations, we demonstrate that the ground eigenstate of the entire structure can be considerably affected by the presence of the wetting layer. The dependency demonstrated between eigenstates of the 'pure' quantum dots and the quantum-well wetting layers indicates that a conventional analysis of quantum-dot structures without accounting for wetting layers may not be sufficient for an adequate characterization of quantum dots as active regions in future electronic and optical devices.",

The main advantages of this theory are its non-linearity, continuous nature (computationally inexpensive), and anisotropy (includes the crystal structure). The theory allows us to account explicitly for internal strain and for realistic interface boundary conditions. The discussion is restricted to cases where the strain is nearly constant on the length scale of the primitive lattice cell except at interfaces where discontinuities are allowed. The main idea behind the theory presented here is to include as much information on the atomic structure in the continuous limit as it is necessary in order to accurately describe nanoscale systems. To illustrate the importance of non-linear effects and the inclusion of internal strain, we present some simple calculation for quantum wells with diamond crystal structure oriented in the [111] direction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a general method of treating Hamiltonians of deformed nanoscale systems is proposed. This method is used to derive a second-order approximation both for the strong and weak formulations of the eigenvalue problem. The weak formulation is needed in order to allow deformations that have discontinuous first derivatives at interfaces between different materials. It is shown that, as long as the deformation is twice differentiable away from interfaces, the weak formulation is equivalent to the strong formulation with appropriate interface boundary conditions. It is also shown that, because the Jacobian of the deformation appears in the weak formulation, the approximations of the weak formulation is not equivalent to the approximations of the strong formulation with interface boundary conditions. The method is applied to two one-dimensional examples (a sinusoidal and a quantum-well potential) and one two-dimensional example (a freestanding quantum wire), where it is shown that the energy eigenvalues of the second-order approximations lie within 1% of the exact energy eigenvalues for a linear strain of up to 9.8%, whereas the first-order approximation has an error of less than 1% for a linear strain of up to 5.5%.",

On the other hand, although a precise mathematical description of the microstructures is known within the framework of Cauchy-Born hypothesis, its discrete version is not well elucidated in the literature, especially for multivariant transformations in three-dimensional samples. A major reason for such a situation lies with computational difficulties connected with quasi-convexity of the associated minimization problem. In this paper we develop a Landau-Ginzburg free energy model for dynamic problems of phase transformations and show a possible link of the developed framework with the continuum description of phase transformations. We demonstrate how the precise description of compatible microstructures in the phase-field model can be used in computational finite element models. The developed framework is sufficiently general to be applied to different types of phase transforming alloys and under general thermo-mechanical loadings. We exemplify the developed technique and its finite element implementation on cubic to tetragonal transformations.",

The model itself is based on the density-gradient theory proposed by Ancona et al. Due to considering angular-symmetric solutions only, two cylindrical coordinates (r and z) suffice for the investigation. Two different numerical implementations of the model employing the finite difference method and finite element method have been used. Influence of the metal contact size on the carrier dynamics and transport inside the nanowire has been investigated. Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics for the same heterostructure nanowire supplemented with different combinations of the metal contacts of different sizes are presented and discussed. It has been demonstrated that the size of the metal contacts strongly influences the carrier dynamics and I-V characteristics of the heterostructure nanowire and that it is possible to produce and tune N-shape of the I-V characteristics by changing the size of the metal contacts. This is of interest in relation to optimization of I-V characteristics of resonant tunneling nanostructures.",

In finance, we often have to deal with stochastic processes with jump-diffusion, so that the FTP problem is reducible to a stochastic differential equation with jump-diffusion. While the application of the conventional Monte-Carlo procedure is possible for the solution of the resulting model, it becomes computationally inefficient which severely restricts its applicability in many practically interesting cases. In this contribution, we focus on the development of efficient Monte-Carlo-based computational procedures for solving the FPT problem under the multivariate (and correlated) jump-diffusion processes. We also discuss the implementation of the developed Monte-Carlo-based technique for multivariate jump-diffusion processes driving by several compound Poisson shocks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the developed methodologies for analyzing the default rates and default correlations of differently rated firms via historical data. ",

In the elongational flow case, by analyzing the governing ordinary differential equations the contribution of the IV to the stress tensor is discussed for fluids subjected to a sudden elongational jerk. In the shear flow case, the governing stochastic differential equation of the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic dumbbell model is solved numerically.

Such linear models are usually derived from the traditional bottom-up approach applied to the analysis of nanostructure properties. At the same time, in the hierarchy of mathematical models for semiconductor device modelling constructed on the basis of the top-down approach, we deal predominantly with models where nonlinearity is essential. In this contribution, we analyze these two fundamental approaches in bridging the scales in mathematical models for the description of optoelectromechanical properties of nanostructures. The focus of the present paper is on a model based on the coupled Schrodinger-Poisson system where we account. consistently for the piezoelectric effect and analyze the influence of different nonlinear terms in strain components. The examples given in this paper show that the piezoelectric effect contributions are essential and have to be accounted for with fully coupled models. While in structural applications of piezoelectric materials at larger scales, the minimization of the full electromechanical energy is now a routine in many engineering applications, in bandstructure engineering conventional approaches are still based on linear models with minimization of uncoupled, purely elastic energy functionals with respect to displacements. Generalizations of the existing models for bandstructure calculations are presented in this paper in the context of coupled effects.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the device current history are reported.",

The simulated maximal lattices sizes are also increased from L = 384 to L=512. Our aim is an improved estimation of the exponent p, describing the Goldstone mode singularity M(h) = M(+0) +ch(rho) at h -> 0, where M is the magnetisation. The data reveal some unexpected small oscillations. It makes the estimation by many-parameter fits of the magnetisation data unstable, and we are looking for an alternative method. Our best estimate p = 0.555(17) is extracted from the analysis of effective exponents determined from local fits of the susceptibility data. This method gives stable and consistent results for both values of, taking into account the leading as well as the subleading correction to scaling.

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising candidates for biomedical x-ray devices and other applications of field emission. CNTs grown/deposited in a thin film are used as cathodes for field emission. In spite of the good performance of such cathodes, the procedure to estimate the device current is not straightforward and the required insight towards design optimization is not well developed. In this paper, we report an analysis aided by a computational model and experiments by which the process of evolution and self-assembly (reorientation) of CNTs is characterized and the device current is estimated. The modeling approach involves two steps: (i) a phenomenological description of the degradation and fragmentation of CNTs and (ii) a mechanics based modeling of electromechanical interaction among CNTs during field emission. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in a time incremental manner. Finally, the device current is obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission and by integrating the current density over computational cells. A detailed analysis of the results reveals the deflected shapes of the CNTs in an ensemble and the extent to which the initial state of geometry and orientation angles affect the device current. Experimental results confirm these effects.",

The mathematical model is based on the Landau theory of phase transformations. Each stable phase is associated with a local minimum of the free energy function, and the phase combinations are simulated by minimizing the bulk energy. At low temperature, the free energy function has double potential wells leading to non-convexity of the optimization problem. The methodology proposed in the present paper is based on an initial estimate of the global solution by a genetic algorithm, followed by a refined quasi-Newton procedure to locally refine the optimum. By combining the local and global search algorithms, the phase combinations are successfully simulated. Numerical experiments are presented for the phase combinations in a SMA patch under several typical mechanical loadings.",

Studying the thermal deformation induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers is important for preventing thermal damage. This article presents a new numerical method for studying thermal deformation in a 3D thin film exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers. The method is obtained based on the parabolic two-step model and implicit finite difference schemes on a staggered mesh. It accounts for the coupling effect between lattice temperature and strain rate, as well as for the hot electron-blast effect in momentum transfer. In particular, a fourth-order compact scheme is developed for evaluating those stress derivatives in the dynamic equations of motion. The method allows us to avoid non-physical oscillations in the solution. Its performance is demonstrated by a numerical example.",

Numerical simulations are reported, which are able to reproduce several experimentally observed phenomena, such as a fluctuating field emission current, deflected CNT tips and the heating process. Examples are shown, where the electrodynamic stretching of the initially deflected CNTs can produce transients in the collective field emission current as large as 10 3 times the usual field emission current. Correspondingly, the tip temperature rises from 303 to 520 K within a time interval of 40 s. A 10 K variability in the maximum temperature is observed over the 0.0144-0.0202 V/nm range of the DC bias electric field.

    "abstract": "The first passage time (FPT) problem is an important problem with a wide range of applications in science, engineering, economics, and industry. Mathematically, such a problem can be reduced to estimating the probability of a stochastic process first to reach a boundary level. In most important applications in the financial industry, the FPT problem does not have an analytical solution and the development of efficient numerical methods becomes the only practical avenue for its solution. Most of our examples in this contribution are centered around the evaluation of default correlations in credit risk analysis, where we are concerned with the joint defaults of several correlated firms, the task that is reducible to a FPT problem. This task represents a great challenge for jump-diffusion processes (JDP). In this contribution, we develop further our previous fast Monte Carlo method in the case of multivariate (and correlated) JDP. This generalization allows us, among other things, to evaluate the default events of several correlated assets based on a set of empirical data. The developed technique is an efficient tool for a number of financial, economic, and business applications, such as credit analysis, barrier option pricing, macroeconomic dynamics, and the evaluation of risk, as well as for a number of other areas of applications in science and engineering, where the FPT problem arises.",

    "abstract": "It is known that with the increasing complexity of technological systems that operate in dynamically changing environments and require human supervision or a human operator, the relative share of human errors is increasing across all modern applications. This indicates that in the analysis and control of such systems, human factors should not be eliminated by conventional formal mathematical methodologies. Instead, they must be incorporated into the modelling framework. In this paper we analyse mathematically how such factors can be effectively incorporated into the analysis and control of complex systems. As an example, we focus our discussion around one of the key problems in the intelligent transportation systems (M) theory and practice, the problem of speed control, considered here as a decision making with limited information available. The problem is cast mathematically in the general framework of control problems and is treated in the context of dynamically changing environments where control is coupled to human factors. Since in this case control might not be limited to a small number of control settings, as it is often assumed in the control literature, serious difficulties arise in the solution of this problem. We demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a set of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations where human factors are incorporated via estimations of the system Hamiltonian. In the ITS context, these estimations can be obtained with the use of on-board equipment like sensors/receivers/actuators, in-vehicle communication devices, etc. The proposed methodology provides a way to integrate human factors into the solving process of the models for other complex dynamic systems.

    "abstract": "Cell cycles are fundamental components of all living organisms and their systematic studies extend our knowledge about the interconnection between regulatory, metabolic, and signaling networks, and therefore open new opportunities for our ultimate efficient control of cellular processes for disease treatments, as well as for a wide variety of biomedical and biotechnological applications. In the study of cell cycles, nonlinear phenomena play a paramount role, in particular in those cases where the cellular dynamics is in the focus of attention. Quantification of this dynamics is a challenging task due to a wide range of parameters that require estimations and the presence of many stochastic effects. Based on the originally deterministic model, in this paper we develop a hierarchy of models that allow us to describe the nonlinear dynamics accounting for special events of cell cycles. First, we develop a model that takes into account fluctuations of relative concentrations of proteins during special events of cell cycles. Such fluctuations are induced by varying rates of relative concentrations of proteins and/or by relative concentrations of proteins themselves. As such fluctuations may be responsible for qualitative changes in the cell, we develop a new model that accounts for the effect of cellular dynamics on the cell cycle. Finally, we analyze numerically nonlinear effects in the cell cycle by constructing phase portraits based on the newly developed model and carry out a parametric sensitivity analysis in order to identify parameters for an efficient cell cycle control. The results of computational experiments demonstrate that the metabolic events in gene regulatory networks can qualitatively influence the dynamics of the cell cycle.",

We analyze such a system for the envelope functions and show that a failure to restrict their Fourier expansion coefficients to small k components would lead to the appearance of non-physical solutions. We survey the existing methodologies to eliminate this difficulty and propose a simple and effective solution. This solution is demonstrated on an example of a two-band model for both bulk materials and low-dimensional nanostructures.

The polycrystalline elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio have been deduced by using Voigt, Reuss, and Hill (VRH) approximations, and the calculated ratio of shear modulus to bulk modulus indicated that AlNi, Al3Ni, AlNi3 and Al3Ni5 compounds are ductile materials, but Al4Ni3 and Al3Ni2 are brittle materials.

The process of evaporation of the ions from the ring upon temperature drop has been found, demonstrating a surprising feature-the uptake of ions by the nanoring increases with the temperature. The connection of this behavior to the dielectric constant of water, hydration and structural changes in the nanoring is discussed. Several properties of the nanoring, such as elastic and transport coefficients, have been determined.

These nanostructures find applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices where they may face challenges for thermal management. Low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum dots (QD) and nanowires, are the nanostructures where such challenges must be particularly carefully addressed. In this contribution we report a study on thermoelectromechanical effects in QDs. For the first time a coupled model of thermoelectroelasticity has been applied to the analysis of quantum dots and the influence of thermoelectromechanical effects on bandstructures of low dimensional nanostructures has been quantified. Finite element solutions are obtained for different thermal loadings and their effects on the electromechanical properties and bandstructure of QDs are presented. Our model accounts for a practically important range of internal and external thermoelectromechanical loadings. Results are obtained for typical QD systems based on GaN/AlN and CdSe/CdS (as representatives of III-V and II-VI group semiconductors, respectively), with cylindrical and truncated conical geometries. The wetting layer effect on electromechanical quantities is also accounted for. The energy bandstructure calculations for various thermal loadings are performed. Electromechanical fields are observed to be more sensitive to thermal loadings in GaN/AlN QDs as compared to CdSe/CdS QDs. The results are discussed in the context of the effect of thermal loadings on the performance of QD-based nanosystems.",

The models in the series have one to three beads per nucleotide and include different amounts of detailed structural information. Such a treatment allows us to reach, for systems of thousands of nucleotides, a time scale of microseconds (i.e. by three orders of magnitude longer than in full atomistic modeling) and thus to enable simulations of large RNA polymers in the context of bionanotechnology. We find that the three-beads-per-nucleotide models, described by a set of just a few universal parameters, are able to describe different RNA conformations and are comparable in structural precision to the models where detailed values of the backbone P-C4' dihedrals taken from a reference structure are included. These findings are discussed in the context of RNA conformation classes. ",

    "abstract": "In a series of recent papers we demonstrated that coupled electro-mechanical effects can lead to pronounced contributions in band structure calculations of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures (LDSNs) such as quantum dots, wires, and even wells. Some such effects are essentially nonlinear. Both strain and piezoelectric effects have been used as tuning parameters for the optical response of LDSNs in photonics, band gap engineering and other applications. However, the influence of spin orbit effects in presence of external magnetic field on single and vertically coupled Quantum Dots (QDs) has been largely neglected in the literature. The electron spin splitting terms which are coupled to the magnetic field through the Pauli spin matrix in these QDs become important in the design of optoelectronic devices as well as in tayloring properties of QDs in other applications areas. At the same time, single and vertically stacked QDs are coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical fields which become increasingly important in many applications of LDSN-based systems, in particular where spin splitting energy is important. These externally applied electric and magnetic fields as well as the separation between the vertically coupled quantum dots can be used as tuning parameters. Indeed, as electromagnetic and elastic effects are often significant in LDSNs, it is reasonable to expect that the externally applied magnetic fields oriented along a direction perpendicular to the plane of $2$ Dimensional Electron Gas ($2$DEG) in the QDs may also be used as a tuning parameter in the application of light emitting diodes, logic devices, for example, OR gates, AND gates and others. In this paper, by using the fully coupled model of electroelasticity, we analyze the influence of these effects on optoelectronic properties of QDs. Results are reported for III-V type semiconductors with a major focus given to AlN/GaN based QD systems.",

In this paper we present analytical expressions and numerical simulations for the spin-flip probabilities during the adiabatic evolution in the presence of the Rashba and Dresselhaus linear spin-orbit interactions. We use the Feynman disentanglement technique to determine the non-Abelian Berry phase and we find exact analytical expressions for three special cases: (i) the pure Rashba spin-orbit coupling, (ii) the pure Dresselhause linear spin-orbit coupling, and (iii) the mixture of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings with equal strength. For a mixture of the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings with unequal strengths, we obtain simulation results by solving numerically the Riccati equation originating from the disentangling procedure. We find that the spin-flip probability in the presence of the mixed spin-orbit couplings is generally larger than those for the pure Rashba case and for the pure Dresselhaus case, and that the complete spin-flip takes place only when the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings are mixed symmetrically.",

The generalized model that accounts for five independent electrostriction coefficients has been solved numerically via a finite-element implementation. The results, exemplified for truncated conical GaN/AlN quantum dots, demonstrate that the effect of nonlinear electrostriction in GaN/AlN nanoheterostructure quantum dots could be significant.

Starting with Goldstone mode singularities in the XY and O(4) models, we briefly review various theoretical concepts, as well as state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulation results. They support recent results of the GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) theory, stating that these singularities are described by certain nontrivial exponents, which differ from those predicted earlier by perturbative treatments. Furthermore, we present the recent Monte Carlo simulation results of the three-dimensional Ising model for lattices with linear sizes up to L = 1536, which are very large as compared to L ≤ 128 usually used in the finite-size scaling analysis. These results are obtained, using a parallel OpenMP implementation of the Wolff single-cluster algorithm. The finite-size scaling analysis of the critical exponent η, assuming the usually accepted correction-to-scaling exponent ω ≈ 0:8, shows that η is likely to be somewhat larger than the value 0.0335 ± 0.0025 of the perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory. Moreover, we have found that the actual data can be well described by different critical exponents: η = ω = 1/8 and ν = 2/3, found within the GFD theory.",

    "abstract": "We develop an analytical method to find plasmons generated by microwaves in a two-dimensional electron gas with defects. The excitations are expressed in terms of the wake field of a charged particle moving in plasma. The result explicitly addresses the efficiency of the photon-to-plasmon conversion and the type of excitation. While strong absorption of the radiation by the excitations is reached at larger plasmon wave numbers, intense persistent plasma waves are created at optimal ones. The latter wave numbers depend on the spectrum of plasmons and the distance that the waves are required to travel without being substantially attenuated. Their type, which can be traveling or standing, is governed by the geometry of the defects and the polarization of the radiation. We identify such types of traveling plasmons as circular plasmons, excited at dot defects, and traverse plasmons, excited at straight wire defects and traveling away from (toward) the wires if their group velocity is positive (negative). Nonlinear excitations are also accounted for. In particular, we analyze the zeroth harmonic, linear in the microwave intensity, which has the character of a frozen charge density wave. The interference of elementary wakes from defects arranged in truncated periodic sets can produce amplified plasmons, which are easily portrayed.",

The governing equations are formulated as nonlinear ordinary differential equations by employing the Euler-Lagrange equation, and can be easily recast into a state space form.

In this paper, we present analytical expressions and numerical simulations of the variation in the Lande g factor for both isotropic and anisotropic quantum dots. Using both analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling has a major contribution in the variation of the g factor with electric fields before the regime, where level crossing or anticrossing occurs. In particular, the electric-field tunability is shown to cover a wide range of g factor through strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Another major result of this paper is that the anisotropic gate potential gives quenching effect in the orbital angular momentum that reduces the variation in the E-field and B-field tunability of the g factor if the area of the symmetric and asymmetric quantum dots is held constant. We identify level crossings and anticrossings of the electron states in the variation of the Lande g factor. We model the wave functions of electron spins and estimate the size of the anticrossing for the spin states vertical bar 0, -1, + 1/2 > and vertical bar 0,0, -1/2 > corresponding to a quantum dot that has been recently studied experimentally [Takahashi et al., Phys.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed investigation of the effects of piezoelectricity, spontaneous polarization and charge density on the electronic states and the quasi-Fermi level energy in wurtzite-type semiconductor heterojunctions. This has required a full solution to the coupled Schr ̈odinger-Poisson-Navier model, as a generalization of earlier work on the Schr ̈odinger-Poisson problem. Finite-element-based simulations have been performed on a AlN/GaN quantum well by using both one-step calculation as well as the self-consistent iterative scheme. Results have been provided for field distributions corresponding to cases with zero-displacement boundary conditions and also stress-free boundary conditions. It has been further demonstrated by using four case study examples that a complete self-consistent coupling of electromechanical fields is essential to accurately capture the electromechanical fields and electronic wavefunctions. We have demonstrated that electronic energies can change up to approximately 0.5 eV when comparing partial and complete coupling of electromechanical fields. Similarly, wavefunctions are significantly altered when following a self-consistent procedure as opposed to the partial coupling case usually considered in literature. Hence, a complete self-consistent procedure is necessary when addressing problems requiring more accurate results on optoelectronic properties of low dimensional nanostructures compared to those obtainable with conventional methodologies.",

Our study shows that anisotropic gate potential enhances the spin-flip rate and reduces the level crossing point to a lower QDs radius due to the suppression of the Lande g-factor towards bulk crystal. In the range of 10(4)-10(6) V/cm, the electric field tunability of the phonon induced spin-flip rate can be manipulated through strong Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. These results might assist the development of a spin based solid state quantum computer by manipulating spin-flip rate through spin-orbit coupling in a regime where the g-factor changes its sign. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the dynamics of martensitic transformations in shape memory alloy (SMA) constrained finite nanostructures is studied using a phase field model with the Ginzburg–Landau free energy. The nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical properties in SMAs have been extensively studied in the bulk case. However at the nanoscale the thermal physics has been usually neglected in a study of SMA properties, and most of the model developments have been carried out under the assumption of isothermal phase transformations. The main aim of this paper is to develop a model that couples the thermal physics and the mechanical dynamics to study the influence of such coupling on the mechanical properties of SMA nanostructures. The developed model is solved using the finite element method. Analyzing FePd alloy nanowires, we observe a steeper slope of the stress–strain curve in the coupled thermo-mechanical case due to temperature evolution during the loading–unloading cycle of such nanostructures. We also observe the martensitic suppression phenomenon in constrained nanowires and nanograins on cooling. We have developed a semi-analytical model to predict a critical size at the onset of martensitic suppression. The semi-analytical model predicts a critical size which is in a good agreement with the numerical results for FePd nanograins. ",

    "abstract": "Shape memory alloy (SMA) is one of the novel advanced functional materials that has an increasing range of current and potential applications, including smart materials and structures, bio-medical and nanotechnologies. This range includes also applications of SMA for control and vibration tuning of various structures, seismic response mitigation, and others. In vibration tuning in many of these applications, it is often necessary to apply supplementary oscillators to absorb the vibration energy input into the primary system. Moreover, when supplementary oscillators are used in these applications, we often have to deal with a situation where the primary vibration frequency is not known a priori. In such cases, we have to design a robust supplementary oscillator such that it is able to operate in a rather wide range of frequencies. A SMA-based oscillator is an ideal candidate for these purposes. In the present paper, we propose a dynamic nonlinear model and its numerical realization for using SMA oscillators as vibration absorbers. The system under consideration consists of a SMA rod and an end-mass. We demonstrate that due to the thermo-mechanical coupling, the vibration characteristics of the supplementary oscillator can be tuned by changing its temperature. The dynamic nonlinear model of the SMA oscillator is simplified for the vibration analysis and an efficient numerical methodology is proposed to evaluate the performance of the oscillator. It is demonstrated that the vibration of the primary system can be tuned within a rather wide frequency range by using the SMA oscillator. It is also shown that at high temperatures the performance of the oscillator is close to that of a linear oscillator, while at low temperatures, the SMA oscillator behaves as a regular damper by using its dissipation due to mechanically-induced phase transformations.",

    "abstract": "We quantify the influence of coupled electromechanical effects on the band structure calculations of wurtzite AlN/GaN quantum dots with wetting layers (WLs). Based on a strain dependent fully coupled 8-band  method, we computed eigenvalues and wavefunctions of electrons in quantum dots with WLs of different aspect ratios. These computed eigenvalues are compared to those obtained from the method based on decoupled 2-conduction and 6-valence bands envelope functions. Previously, such comparisons, accounting for the wetting layer, were systematically done only for models based on not more than 4-bands. In addition, we apply gate potential along z-direction to bring the conduction and valence bands closer so that we numerically estimate the influence of gate controlled electric fields on the intra-subband energy in quantum dots. Due to the non-parabolicity term in the effective mass approximation, our study shows that the intra-sub band energy (i.e., the energy difference between ground and first excited states) is smaller for electrons and larger for holes in the 8-band  method than those eigenvalues obtained from the decoupled 2-conduction and 6-valence bands envelope functions method. In this paper, we show that the intra-sub band energy increases in presence of piezo-electromechanical effects and externally applied gate potentials along z-direction. We numerically estimate the distribution (i.e., the probability density) of electrons and holes wavefunctions in the dots that is obtained from both the 8-band  method and the decoupled 2- and 6-bands envelope functions method.",

Our aim is to test some challenging theoretical predictions, according to which the exponents λ⊥ and λ|| are non-trivial (3/2<λ⊥<2 and 0<λ||<1 in three dimensions) and the ratio b M2/a2 (where M is a spontaneous magnetization) is universal. The trivial standard-theoretical values are λ⊥=2 and λ||=1. Our earlier MC analysis gives λ⊥=1.955 ± 0.020 and λ|| about 0.9 for the O(4) model. A recent MC estimation of λ||, assuming corrections to scaling of the standard theory, yields λ|| = 0.69 ± 0.10 for the O(2) model. Currently, we have performed a similar MC estimation for the O(10) model, yielding λ⊥ = 1.9723(90). We have observed that the plot of the effective transverse exponent for the O(4) model is systematically shifted down with respect to the same plot for the O(10) model by Δ λ⊥ = 0.0121(52). It is consistent with the idea that 2-λ⊥ decreases for large n and tends to zero at n → ∞. We have also verified and confirmed the expected universality of b M2/a2 for the O(4) model, where simulations at two different temperatures (couplings) have been performed.",

Mathematically, such problems are often reduced to the evaluation of the probability density of the time for such a process to cross a certain level, a boundary, or to enter a certain region. While in other areas of applications the FPT problem can often be solved analytically, in finance we usually have to resort to the application of numerical procedures, in particular when we deal with jump-diffusion stochastic processes (JDP). In this paper, we propose a Monte-Carlo-based methodology for the solution of the FPT problem in the context of multivariate (and correlated) JDPs.

These thermodynamic models are non-isothermal and allow to account for the thermo-mechanical material properties of both austenite and martensite phases based on the local phase value of the order parameter. They are based on the Ginzburg–Landau free energy and the phase field theory. The core of the models is a phase evolution governed by the time dependent Ginzburg–Landau (TDGL) equation and the conservation balance laws with nonlinear coupling between stress, strain and the phase order parameter. The models account for the gradient energy and have been tested in the study of material properties evolution under harmonic stress loading for all important practical cases. The representative numerical simulations have been carried out here without the gradient energy term. The developed models account for the phase dependent properties based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order parameter and stress. We also compared the results obtained with these models and observed differences in homogeneous and inhomogeneous situations due to the change in compliance. In this way, the description of quasiplastic and pseudoelastic behaviors in SMA specimens is improved and becomes in an agreement with existing experiments.",

Thus, the conventional power-law scaling ansatz can be questioned because of this inconsistency. We have found that the data are well described by certain logarithmic ansatz.",

The modulation potential can be obtained from realistically grown superlattices (SLs). Our study shows that the Rashba spin–orbit interaction induces the level crossing point in the parabolic nanowire SLs. We estimate large anticrossing width (approximately 117 µeV) between singlet–triplet states. We study the phonon and electromagnetic field mediated spin transition rates in the parabolic nanowire SLs. We report that the phonon mediated spin transition rate is several order of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic field mediated spin transition rate. Based on the Feynman disentangling technique, we find the exact spin transition probability. For the case wave vector k = 0, we report that the transition probability can be tuned in the form of resonance at fixed time interval. For the general case (k ≠ 0), we solve the Riccati equation and find that the arbitrary values of k induces the damping in the transition probability. At large value of Rashba spin–orbit coupling coefficients for (k ≠ 0), spin transition probability freezes.",

The model consists of a Boltzmann–Poisson type system of equations with simplified Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook collisions, obtained from the general time-dependent Schrödinger–Poisson model using Wigner functions. This system for superlattice transport is supplemented by the quantum mechanical part of the model based on the Ben-Daniel–Duke form of the Schrödinger equation for a cylindrical superlattice of finite radius. The resulting energy spectrum is used to characterize the Fermi–Dirac distribution that appears in the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook collision, thereby coupling the quantum mechanical and kinetic parts of the model. The kinetic model uses the dispersion relation obtained by the generalized Kronig–Penney method, and allows us to estimate radii of quantum wire superlattices that have the same miniband widths as in experiments. It also allows us to determine more accurately the time-dependent characteristics of superlattices, in particular their current density. Results, for several experimentally grown superlattices, are discussed in the context of self-sustained coherent oscillations of the current density which are important in an increasing range of current and potential applications.",

The coupled piezo-electromechanical model for semiconductor materials takes into account the strain, piezoelectric effects, and spontaneous polarization. Based on the developed 3D model, the band structures of electrons (holes) obtained from results of modeling in Cartesian coordinates are in good agreement with those values obtained from our earlier developed 2D model in cylindrical coordinates. Several parameters such as lattice mismatch, piezo-electric fields, valence, and conduction band offsets at the heterojunction of AlxGa1–xN/GaN superlattice can be varied as a function of the Al mole fraction. When the band offsets at the heterojunction of AlxGa1–xN/GaN are very small and the influence of the piezo-electromechanical effects can be minimized, then the barrier material can no longer be treated as an infinite potential well. In this situation, it is possible to visualize the penetration of the Bloch wave function into the barrier material that provides an estimation of critical radii of NWSLs. In this case, the NWSLs can act as inversion layers. Finally, we investigate the influence of symmetry of the square and cylindrical NWSLs on the band structures of electrons in the conduction band.",

    "abstract": "In symmetric quantum dots (QDs), it is well known that the spin hot spot (i.e., the cusplike structure due to the presence of degeneracy near the level or anticrossing point) is present for the pure Rashba case but is absent for the pure Dresselhaus case [Bulaev and Loss, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 076805 (2005)]. Since the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling dominates over the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in GaAs and GaSb QDs, it is important to find the exact location of the spin hot spot or the cusplike structure even for the pure Dresselhaus case. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical results that show that the spin hot spot can also be seen for the pure Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling case by inducing large anisotropy through external gates. At or nearby the spin hot spot, the spin transition rate increases and the decoherence time decreases by several orders of magnitude compared to the case with no spin hot spot. Thus one should avoid such locations when designing QD spin based transistors for possible implementation in quantum logic gates, solid-state quantum computing, and quantum information processing. It is also possible to extract the exact experimental data [Amasha, MacLean, Radu, Zumbühl, Kastner, Hanson, and Gossard, Phys. Rev.

Based on Monte Carlo (MC) data, we confirm the fact stated earlier by Engels and Vogt, that the transverse two-plane correlation function of the (4) model for lattice sizes about L = 120 and small external fields h is very well described by a Gaussian approximation. However, we show that fits of not lower quality are provided by certain non-Gaussian approximation. We have also tested larger lattice sizes, up to L = 512. The Fourier-transformed transverse and longitudinal two-point correlation functions have Goldstone mode singularities in the thermodynamic limit at k → 0 and h = +0, i.e., G⊥ (k) ≃ ak–λ⊥ and G‖(k)≃bk–λ‖, respectively. Here a and b are the amplitudes, k = |k| is the magnitude of the wave vector k. The exponents λᚆ, λ‖ and the ratio bM2/a2, where M is the spontaneous magnetization, are universal according to the GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) approach. Here we find that the universality follows also from the standard (Gaussian) theory, yielding bM2/a2=(n−1)/16. Our MC estimates of this ratio are 0.06±0.01 for n=2, 0.17±0.01 for n = 4 and 0.498±0.010 for n = 10. According to these and our earlier MC results, the asymptotic behavior and Goldstone mode singularities are not exactly described by the standard theory. This is expected from the GFD theory. We have found appropriate analytic approximations for G⊥(k) and G‖(k), well fitting the simulation data for small k. We have used them to test the Patashinski-Pokrovski relation and have found that it holds approximately.",

The phase-field model with Ginzburg–Landau energy, having appropriate strain based order parameter and strain gradient energy contributions, is used to study the martensitic transformations in the representative 2D square-to-rectangular phase transformations for FePd SMA nanowires. The microstructure and mechanical behavior of martensitic transformations in SMA nanostructures have been studied extensively in the literature for uniaxial loading, usually under isothermal assumptions. The developed model describes the martensitic transformations in SMAs based on the equations for momentum and energy with bi-directional coupling via strain, strain rate and temperature. These governing equations of the thermo-mechanical model are numerically solved simultaneously for different external loadings starting with the evolved twinned and austenitic phases. We observed a strong influence of multi-axial loading on dynamic thermo-mechanical properties of SMA nanowires. Notably, the multi-axial loadings are quite distinct as compared to the uniaxial loading case, and the particular axial stress level is reached at a lower strain. The SMA behaviors predicted by the model are in qualitative agreements with experimental and numerical results published in the literature. The new results reported here on the nanowire response to multi-axial loadings provide new physical insight into underlying phenomena and are important, for example, in developing better SMA-based MEMS and NEMS devices\n",

It has been demonstrated that with increasing grain size, both GBs and size effects become weaker, while size effects become stronger on thermal conductivity than GBs effects.",

Thermoelectromechanical effects are treated via pseudomorphic vector potentials to analyze the influence of these coupled effects on the band structures of bilayer-graphene quantum dots. We report that the level crossing between the ground and first-excited states in the localized edge states can be achieved with accessible values of temperature. In particular, the level-crossing point extends to higher temperatures with decreasing externally applied tensile edge stress along the armchair direction. This kind of level crossing is absent in the states formed at the center of the graphene sheet due to the presence of threefold symmetry.",

Besides, the water splitting reaction is found to be a thermally activated process, and the first hydrogen atom is easier decomposing from the adsorbed water molecule than the second one for most of the 3C-SiC surfaces. Furthermore, the water molecule that splitting on 3C-SiC (1 1 1) surface requires relatively small activation energy by contrast with other surfaces.

The model is of phase-field type and is based on the Ginzburg–Landau theory. The hysteresis and phase transformations are governed by the kinetic phase evolution equation using the scalar order parameter, laws of conservation of the momentum and energy and a nonlinear coupling of the stress, the strain and the order parameter in a differential form. One of the important features of the model is that the phase transformation is governed by the stress tensor, as opposed to the transformation strain tensor typically used in the literature. The model takes into account different properties of austenite and martensite phases based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order parameter and stress. Representative numerical simulations on an SMA specimen reproduce hysteretic behaviors observed experimentally in the literature.\n",

The process of knowledge creation requires meaningful, logically coordinated interactions, which represents a challenging problem to physics and social dynamics modeling. By combining two-scale dynamics model with empirical data analysis from a well-known Questions & Answers system Mathematics, we show that this process occurs as a collective phenomenon in an enlarged network (of actors and their artifacts) where the cognitive recognition interactions are properly encoded. The emergent behavior is quantified by the information divergence and innovation advancing of knowledge over time and the signatures of self-organization and knowledge sharing communities. These measures elucidate the impact of each cognitive element and the individual actor’s expertise in the collective dynamics. The results are relevant to stochastic processes involving smart components and to collaborative social endeavors, for instance, crowdsourcing scientific knowledge production with online games.",

Such spin splitting energy is highly dependent on the material properties of semiconductor. It turns out that this energy is in the range of meV and can be further enhanced with increasing pulse frequency.

The overall dynamics of the polycrystalline materials is obtained by taking a weighted combination of the dynamics of all magnetic domains. The weight function for the combination is taken as the distribution function of the principal axes. Numerical simulations are performed and comparisons with its experimental counterparts are presented. The hysteretic dynamics caused by orientation switching processes is accurately captured by the proposed model. Minor hysteresis loops associated with partial-amplitude loadings are also captured.

It is found that if the order of truncation is not less than the order of the initial conditions, the assumed-mode method can yield accurate results. The energy transfers among assumed modes are discussed during retraction. The total energy varying with time has been investigated by numerical and analytical methods, and the results have good agreement with each other.

Here, we use the empirical evidence from questions-and-answers in mathematics to analyse the emergence of the network of knowledge contents (or tags) as the individual experts use them in the process. After removing extra edges from the network-associated graph, we apply the methods of algebraic topology of graphs to examine the structure of higher-order combinatorial spaces in networks for four consecutive time intervals. We find that the ranking distributions of the suitably scaled topological dimensions of nodes fall into a unique curve for all time intervals and filtering levels, suggesting a robust architecture of knowledge networks. Moreover, these networks preserve the logical structure of knowledge within emergent communities of nodes, labeled according to a standard mathematical classification scheme. Further, we investigate the appearance of new contents over time and their innovative combinations, which expand the knowledge network. In each network, we identify an innovation channel as a subgraph of triangles and larger simplices to which new tags attach. Our results show that the increasing topological complexity of the innovation channels contributes to network’s architecture over different time periods, and is consistent with temporal correlations of the occurrence of new tags. The methodology applies to a wide class of data with the suitable temporal resolution and clearly identified knowledge-content units.",

According to our analysis, amplitudes of the nontrivial correction terms with the correction–to–scaling exponents ωℓ<1 become small when approaching the Ising limit (λ→∞), but such corrections generally exist in the 2D φ4 model. Analytical arguments show the existence of corrections with the exponent 3∕4.

    "abstract": "Based on the atomic cluster structures and free electron approximation model, it is revealed that the electrochemical potential (ECP) for the system of interest is proportional to the reciprocal of atomic cluster radius squared, i.e., φ = k·(1/r2). Applied to elemental crystals, the correlation between atomic cluster radii and the ECP that we have predicted agrees well with the previously reported results. In addition, some other physicochemical properties associated with the ECP have also been found relevant to the atomic cluster radii of materials. Thus, the atomic cluster radii can be perceived as an effective characteristic parameter to measure the ECP and related properties of materials. Our results provide a better understanding of ECP directly from the atomic structures perspective.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of shape memory alloy (SMA) nanostructures is influenced by strain rate and temperature evolution during dynamic loading. The coupling between temperature, strain, and strain rate is essential to capture inherent thermomechanical behavior in SMAs. In this paper, we propose a new 3D phase-field model that accounts for two-way coupling between mechanical and thermal physics. We use the strain-based Ginzburg-Landau potential for cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformations. The variational formulation of the developed model is implemented in the isogeometric analysis framework to overcome numerical challenges. We have observed a complete disappearance of the out-of-plane martensitic variant in a very high aspect ratio SMA domain as well as the presence of three variants in equal portions in a low aspect ratio SMA domain. The dependence of different boundary conditions on the microstructure morphology has been examined energetically. The tensile tests on rectangular prism nanowires, using the displacement based loading, demonstrate the shape memory effect and pseudoelastic behavior. We have also observed that higher strain rates, as well as the lower aspect ratio domains, resulting in high yield stress and phase transformations occur at higher stress during dynamic axial loading.",

Due to the cubic symmetry, the Fermi surface of sc-C96 is constituted of three nodal line circles.

We argue that the Zeeman pseudospin (p-spin) splitting energy induced by ripple waves might not be neglected for smaller widths of armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We show that the p-spin splitting energy breaks the symmetry of degeneracy due to the ripple-induced Zeeman effect in GNRs, originating from electromechanical coupling. We estimate the p-spin lifetime in strained armchair GNRs caused by in-plane phonon modes for possible applications in straintronics and quantum information processing. By considering higher order terms in the strain tensor expansion, we also demonstrate that highly asymmetric band structures of GNRs induce asymmetric phonon-mediated p-spin relaxation. Such asymmetric p-spin relaxation is not possible for unstrained armchair and zigzag GNRs. In particular, we report that the p-spin transition rate decreases like B 5 0 (as a function of p-magnetic fields), L − 9 (as a function of GNR width) and τ −1e, where τe is the externally applied tensile edge stress.",

By the complex mode analysis we classify the out-of-unison planar motion into two types, gyroscopic motions and elliptic motions. It is found that the gyroscopic and elliptic motions have different characteristics for a two degree-of-freedom (2DOF) system. The gyroscopic motion involves two distinct frequencies with, respectively, two corresponding complex modes. However, the elliptic motion the nonlinear non-gyroscopic 2DOF system with repeated frequencies involves only single frequency with corresponding two complex modes.

A numerical estimation of ω from the susceptibility data within 40≤L≤2560 yields ω=0.21(29), in agreement with this statement. We reconsider the MC estimation of ω from smaller lattice sizes, L≤384, using different finite-size scaling methods, and show that these sizes are still too small, since no convergence to the same result is observed. In particular, estimates ranging from ω=0.866(21) to ω=1.247(73) are obtained, using MC data for thermodynamic average quantities, as well as for partition function zeros. However, a trend toward smaller ω values is observed in one of these cases in a refined estimation from extended data up to L=1536.

Analysis with phonon kinetic theory shows that low thermal conductivity in the Si/Ge hetero-twinned SLs is caused by the combined actions of reduced phonon group velocity and reduced relaxation time. Moreover, despite similar thermal conductivity in Si/Ge hetero-twinned SLs and conventional Si/Ge SLs, the phonon group velocity and relaxation time in the two structures are totally different.

We study the bandgap opening due to strain induced ripple waves and investigate the interplay between pseudomagnetic fields and externally applied magnetic fields on the band structures and spin relaxation in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We show that electron-hole bands of GNRs are highly influenced (i.e. level crossing of the bands are possible) by coupling two combined effects: pseudomagnetic fields (PMF) originating from strain tensor and external magnetic fields. In particular, we show that the tuning of the spin-splitting band extends to large externally applied magnetic fields with increasing values of pseudomagnetic fields. Level crossings of the bands in strained GNRs can also be observed due to the interplay between pseudomagnetic fields and externally applied magnetic fields. We also investigate the influence of this interplay on the electromagnetic field mediated spin relaxation mechanism in GNRs. In particular, we show that the spin hot spot can be observed at approximately B = 65 T (the externally applied magnetic field) and B0 = 53 T (the magnitude of induced pseudomagnetic field due to ripple waves) which may not be considered as an ideal location for the design of straintronic devices. Our analysis might be used for tuning the bandgaps in strained GNRs and utilized to design the optoelectronic devices for straintronic applications.",

    "abstract": "In online social dynamics, a robust scale invariance appears as a key feature of collaborative efforts that lead to new social value. The underlying empirical data thus offers a unique opportunity to study the origin of self-organized criticality (SOC) in social systems. In contrast to physical systems in the laboratory, various human attributes of the actors play an essential role in the process along with the contents (cognitive, emotional) of the communicated artifacts. As a prototypical example, we consider the social endeavor of knowledge creation via Questions and Answers (Q&A). Using a large empirical data set from one of such Q&A sites and theoretical modeling, we reveal fundamental characteristics of SOC by investigating the temporal correlations at all scales and the role of cognitive contents to the avalanches of the knowledge-creation process. Our analysis shows that the universal social dynamics with power-law inhomogeneities of the actions and delay times provides the primary mechanism for self-tuning towards the critical state; it leads to the long-range correlations and the event clustering in response to the external driving by the arrival of new users. In addition, the involved cognitive contents (systematically annotated in the data and observed in the model) exert important constraints that identify unique classes of the knowledge-creation avalanches. Specifically, besides determining a fine structure of the developing knowledge networks, they affect the values of scaling exponents and the geometry of large avalanches and shape the multifractal spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the level of the activity of the communities that share the knowledge correlates with the fluctuations of the innovation rate, implying that the increase of innovation may serve as the active principle of self-organization. To identify relevant parameters and unravel the role of the network evolution underlying the process in the social system under consideration, we compare the social avalanches to the avalanche sequences occurring in the field-driven physical model of disordered solids, where the factors contributing to the collective dynamics are better understood.",

Such a system exhibits an optical response that is extremely sensitive to gap between the nanowire and film which makes it favorable for various sensing applications. The nonlocal effect of the plasmonic medium significantly affects the resonant wavelength of the coupled system for structures of small dimensions (less than 10 nm). We present new computational results that can be used to predict the effect of non-locality on the resonances of the system.

Experimental results suggest that ions present in sea water, also called smart water, have a significant influence on the wettability alteration (less oil wet) of calcite surface. In this paper, by utilizing Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) simulations, we investigate the effect of additive ions of sea water in oil recovery by using acetic acid as a model compound of crude oil molecules. We find that Na+ ions precipitate to the calcite surface and form Na acetate. The binding energy of Na acetate is larger than original oil molecule (acetic acid), which reduces oil recovery. On the other hand, Mg2+ and SO2−4 ions can also reach to the calcite surface in proximity and modify the calcite surface. The binding energy of oil molecule on modified calcite surface is smaller than on pure calcite surface, which enhances oil recovery. Our results might help in understanding interaction among oil, water and additives ions of smart water for further experimental investigations.",

A non-convex Helmholtz free energy based on Landau theory is proposed to model the switching dynamics. The governing equation of single-crystal model is formulated by applying the Euler–Lagrange equation. The polycrystalline model is obtained by combining the single crystal dynamics with a density function which is constructed to model the weighted contributions of different grains with different principle axis orientations. In addition, numerical simulations of hysteretic dynamics with creep phenomenon are presented. Comparison of the numerical results and their experimental counterparts is also presented.

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of surface interaction between crude oil molecule and calcite can pave a way to explain several fundamental challenges of wettability alteration of calcite surface and hence provide a guidance for further enhancement of crude oil recovery. In the enhanced crude oil recovery stage, additives, Mg2+ and SO42− ions of sea water alter the relative wettability characteristics (from oil-wet to less oil-wet) of calcite surface that enhances the crude oil recovery. In this paper, we consider naphthenic acid is a model compound of crude oil molecule, perform Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and checking its relative binding energy (i.e. the binding energy difference between water and oil molecule) is an indication of relative wettability alteration of calcite surface. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Mg2+ ion replaces Ca2+ of calcite and then SO42− ion replaces CO32− of calcite. The relative binding energy of oil molecule is larger on modified calcite.MgSO4 surface than on pure calcite surface, providing an indication of less oil wet calcite surface. Ab initio molecular results also show that few Na+ ions of sea water reach to the calcite surface as a precipitate and form Na naphthenates that make oil molecule more sticker (more oil-wet) to the rock surface. Combined study of DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations can help to understand the surface interaction between oil molecule and calcite surface in aqueous sea water environment that has global impact on crude oil recovery from calcite oil reservoirs.",

In this paper, we study the dynamics of a beam with both axial moving motion and spinning motion as a prototype of bi-gyroscopic continua. The influence of bi-gyroscopic effects on the natural frequencies, modes, and stability is investigated by an analytical method applied to the discretized equations of the axially moving and spinning beam. Distinct bifurcation series of the eigenvalues and corresponding physical interpretations are discussed by numerical display of the modal motions. The complex modes describing both whirling motions and traveling waves are investigated in detail for such bi-gyroscopic system.

In this article, the influence of different materials on the energy-harvesting performance associated with this new strategy is further studied. The state-of-the-art phase-field model is adopted to investigate the nonlinear hysteretic energy-harvesting process in two nanoscale ferroelectric energy harvesters, which are respectively based on two typical ferroelectric materials—single-crystal BaTiO3 and PbTiO3. In both cases, the effects of the bias voltage and bias resistance are carefully investigated and the optimum values are obtained. Later, the energy-harvesting process and energy flow details in both harvesters working at the optimum conditions are presented and carefully compared in the context of real applications. Furthermore, the energy-harvesting performance of a BaTiO3-based nanoscale piezoelectric energy harvester with equivalent material size is additionally simulated with the finite element method and compared with the corresponding results of the ferroelectric energy harvesters, where obvious advantages associated with the new strategy are demonstrated.",

In this paper, homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation nature for diamond 16112 glide set dislocation and 12110 shuffle set dislocation is studied by combining molecular dynamics method and continuum mechanics models. Our results show that although heterogeneous dislocation nucleation can decrease its activation energy, the activation energy at 0 GPa for diamond heterogeneous nucleation is still in the range of 100 eV. For 16112 glide set and 12110 shuffle set homogeneous nucleation, their critical nucleation shear stress approaches to diamond's ideal shear strength which implies that those dislocations do not nucleate before diamond structural instability only by a purely shearing manner. While for 16112 glide set and 12110 shuffle set heterogeneous nucleation, their critical nucleation shear stresses are 28.9 GPa and 48.2 GPa, these values are less than diamond's ideal shear strength which implies that these dislocations may be nucleated heterogeneously under certain shear stress condition. In addition, our results also indicate there exists a deformation mode transformation for diamond deformation behavior at strain rate of 10−3/s. Our results provide a new insight into diamond dislocation nucleation and deformation.",

Graphene and diamond with standard sp2 and sp3 hybridization, respectively, are also examined for comparison. Our results indicate that the thermal conductivities of T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 at room temperature are much lower than those of diamond and graphene. Phonon kinetic theory analysis shows that the lower thermal conductivity of T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 is caused by the combined action of their reduced phonon group velocities and relaxation time.

    "abstract": "Piezoelectric composites are a class of smart materials which can be manufactured in a scalable manner by additive processes, while catering to a wide range of applications. Recent efforts are directed towards composites of lead-free piezoelectric materials with a goal of achieving performances comparable to lead-based composites. While there has been extensive research in fabrication methodologies such as 3D printing, which can manufacture complex piezoelectric structures in a scalable manner, there are important remaining questions as to how the performance of lead-free piezoelectric composites can be further improved. Fundamental to this is the understanding of key factors underlying piezoelectric performance: the electro-elastic interactions between the piezoelectric material and the matrix, the effects of the polycrystalline microstructure of the piezoelectric inclusions, the effect of randomly shaped polycrystalline fillers, and the effect of the volume fraction of the piezoelectric material in the matrix. A strong motivation for using polycrystalline fillers is that they can exhibit enhanced piezoelectric and mechanical properties compared to single crystalline materials. Moreover, polycrystalline materials are amenable to scalable manufacturing. We computationally investigate these important aspects of piezoelectric composite design and performance by taking into account for the first time the polycrystalline nature of lead-free piezoelectric inclusions, in the context of a matrix-inclusion composite. We achieve this by dispersing randomly shaped polycrystalline inclusions at random positions in the matrix which allows us to better understand the behavior of practical composite architectures. In such cases, our analysis reveals that although polycrystalline piezoelectric materials, in isolation, can outperform their single crystal counterparts, in a composite architecture these enhancements are not straightforward. We identify the sources of loss which prevent polycrystalline inclusions from enhancing the performance of the composites. By tuning the dielectric environment in the matrix through the inclusion of metallic nanoparticles, we demonstrate how the performance of the composites can be further significantly improved. Specifically, when the metal nanoparticles are near the percolation threshold, we show that polycrystalline piezoelectric inclusions perform better than single crystals, with an improvement of around 14.6% in the effective piezoelectric response. We conclude that such novel architectures, devised by a combination of polycrystalline piezoelectric inclusions in a high permittivity environment, can improve the performance of the composites beyond the single crystal design and thus offer a promising direction for 3D printable lead-free piezoelectric composites.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative self-assembly is a ubiquitous phenomenon found in natural systems which is used for designing nanostructured materials with new functional features. Its origin and mechanisms, leading to improved functionality of the assembly, have attracted much attention from researchers in many branches of science and engineering. These complex structures often come with hyperbolic geometry; however, the relation between the hyperbolicity and their spectral and dynamical properties remains unclear. Using the model of aggregation of simplexes introduced by Šuvakov et al. [Sci. Rep. 8, 1987 (2018)], here we study topological and spectral properties of a large class of self-assembled structures or nanonetworks consisting of monodisperse building blocks (cliques of size n=3,4,5,6) which self-assemble via sharing the geometrical shapes of a lower order. The size of the shared substructure is tuned by varying the chemical affinity ν such that for significant positive ν sharing the largest face is the most probable, while for ν<0, attaching via a single node dominates. Our results reveal that, while the parameter of hyperbolicity remains δmax=1 across the assemblies, their structure and spectral dimension ds vary with the size of cliques n and the affinity when ν≥0. In this range, we find that ds>4 can be reached for n≥5 and sufficiently large ν. For the aggregates of triangles and tetrahedra, the spectral dimension remains in the range ds∈[2,4), as well as for the higher cliques at vanishing affinity. On the other end, for ν<0, we find ds≂1.57 independently on n. Moreover, the spectral distribution of the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues has a characteristic shape with peaks and a pronounced minimum, representing the hierarchical architecture of the simplicial complexes. These findings show how the structures compatible with complex dynamical properties can be assembled by controlling the higher-order connectivity among the building blocks.",

However, the latent structure on higher-order interactions remains unexplored, where many brain regions act in synergy to perform complex functions. Here we use the simplicial complexes description of human connectome, where the shared simplexes encode higher-order relationships between groups of nodes. We study consensus connectome of 100 female (F-connectome) and of 100 male (M-connectome) subjects that we generated from the Budapest Reference Connectome Server v3.0 based on data from the Human Connectome Project. Our analysis reveals that the functional geometry of the common F&M-connectome coincides with the M-connectome and is characterized by a complex architecture of simplexes to the 14th order, which is built in six anatomical communities, and linked by short cycles. The F-connectome has additional edges that involve different brain regions, thereby increasing the size of simplexes and introducing new cycles. Both connectomes contain characteristic subjacent graphs that make them 3/2-hyperbolic. These results shed new light on the functional architecture of the brain, suggesting that insightful differences among connectomes are hidden in their higher-order connectivity.",

However, lead-free materials lag lead-based piezo-composites in terms of performance, thus necessitating new design strategies to escalate piezoelectric response. Here, we build a modeling paradigm for improving the piezoelectric performance through improved matrices and optimal polycrystallinity in the piezoelectric inclusions. By incorporating carbon nanotubes in the matrix, we demonstrate 2–3 orders of improvement in the piezoelectric response, through simultaneous hardening of the matrix and improvement in its permittivity. By tuning the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions, we show considerable improvements exceeding 50% in the piezo-response, compared to single crystal inclusions. We further analyze the influence of carbon nanotube agglomerations at supramolecular length scales, as well as vacancy defects in the nanotubes at the atomic level, on composite performance. Although nanomaterial agglomeration is conventionally considered undesirable, we show that, near nanotube percolation, clustering of nanotubes can lead to better matrix hardening and higher permittivities, leading to improvements exceeding 30% in the piezoelectric response compared to non-agglomerated architectures. We further demonstrate that although atomic vacancy defects in nanotubes effectively soften the matrix, this can be compensated by agglomeration of nanotubes at larger length-scales.",

Numerical modeling and simulations play an important role in prediction of temperature distribution and damage volume during the treatment planning stage of associated therapies. In this contribution we report a coupled thermo-electro-mechanical model, accounting for heat relaxation time, for more accurate and precise prediction of the temperature distribution, tissue deformation and damage volume during the thermal ablation of biological tissues. Finite element solutions are obtained for most widely used percutaneous thermal ablative techniques, viz., radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Importantly, both tissue expansion and shrinkage have been considered for modeling the tissue deformation in the coupled model of high temperature thermal ablation. The coupled model takes into account the non-Fourier effects, considering both single-phase-lag (SPL) and dual-phase-lag (DPL) models of bio-heat transfer. The temperature-dependent electrical and thermal parameters, damage-dependent blood perfusion rate and phase change effect accounting for tissue vaporization have been accounted for obtaining more clinically relevant model. The proposed model predictions are found to be in good agreement against the temperature distribution and damage volume reported by previous experimental studies. The numerical simulation results revealed that the non-Fourier effects cause a decrease in the predicted temperature distribution, tissue deformation and damage volume during the high temperature thermal ablative procedures. Furthermore, the effects of different magnitudes of phase lags of the heat flux and temperature gradient on the predicted treatment outcomes of the considered thermal ablative modalities are also quantified and discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "Lead-free piezoelectric composites with polymeric matrices offer a scalable and eco-friendly solution to sensing and energy harvesting applications. Piezoelectric polymers such as PVDF are particularly interesting because of the possibility to engineer the performance of these materials through addition of higher-performance piezoelectric inclusions and nanomaterials and to scalably manufacture such composites by emerging techniques such as 3D printing. This work makes two contributions, namely towards composite design and towards development of accurate effective property models. In the context of composite design, we evaluate the piezoelectric performance of PVDF modified by the addition of polycrystalline-BaTiO3 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Firstly, the addition of BaTiO3 dramatically improves the electric field within the composite offering significant advantages specially at low BaTiO3 concentrations. Secondly, the addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix, particularly at higher BaTiO3 loadings, leads to an order of magnitude increase in the piezoelectric flux generation. Further enhancement in the flux generation is also possible by tuning the polycrystallinity of the BaTiO3 inclusions. However, these behaviours are inclusion-driven and the piezoelectric behaviour of the matrix does not contribute to this improvement. Importantly, a small addition of BaTiO3 and CNT into the PVDF matrix, away from percolation, can simultaneously improve flux and electric field generation. In this part of the work, we assume an isotropic PVDF matrix. Given that PVDF is elastically anisotropic, the second aspect of this work is the development of an effective property model for CNT-modified PVDF, taking into account the elastic anisotropy of poled PVDF, to predict the elastic coefficients of CNT-modified PVDF matrices, thus undertaking a key step towards modelling anisotropic piezoelectric composites. We show that the anisotropy-based model makes similar predictions in the effective composite behaviour, indicating that in the case of PVDF-based piezocomposites, the anisotropy of the matrix does not significantly affect the piezoresponse.",

Current piezocomposite design heavily relies on the linear piezoelectric model which neglects nonlocal and nonlinear electro-elastic processes. Here we develop a more accurate modelling paradigm to determine the contributions from nonlocal flexoelectric and nonlinear electrostrictive effects towards the performance of lead-free piezocomposites. We find that in the case of microscale randomly shaped piezoelectric inclusions which represent a practical scenario, the flexoelectric effect does not contribute appreciably towards the piezoelectric response. However, the nonlinear electrostrictive effects impart significant strain-dependent responses. Further, in nano-modified composites, we find that the nonlinear electro-mechanical coupling can have different effects on the transverse and the longitudinal electro-elastic responses. In particular, the longitudinal electric field response, with the nonlinear contribution, is less sensitive to the polycrystalline structure of the piezoelectric inclusions. These observations clearly indicate that at larger strains, nonlinear effects cannot be neglected. In general, our results entail that it is important to include nonlocal and nonlinear processes for reliable and accurate modelling of piezocomposites.",

Therefore, in the context of mechanically superior high-performance piezo-composites, graphene-modified composite architectures represent an important design direction. In this paper, we first develop an effective property model for graphene-modified piezoelectric matrices, taking into account the mechanical anisotropy of the matrix. We further evaluate the piezoelectric performance of the matrix architecture which incorporates lead-free BaTiO3 polycrystal inclusions. In order to obtain comparisons with well-established composites, we compare the electro-elastic response of two composite architectures in which the matrix is modified by multiwalled CNTs and graphene respectively. It is seen that, near percolation of the nano-additions, graphene-based systems exhibit an order of improvement in the piezoelectric response compared to the composite without nano modification. This improvement is comparable to CNT-based systems, but the matrix hardening is lesser than half the hardening observed in CNT-modified composites. This feature is due to a considerably smaller percolation threshold of graphene compared to CNTs which brings about percolative conditions at very small filler concentrations. We further investigate the dependence of the electric flux and fields in the graphene-modified piezocomposite on the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions to identify the polycrystalline configurations that can lead to improved performance in such nanomodified piezocomposites.",

    "abstract": "While lead-free piezocomposites offer an environmentally friendly solution to mechanical sensing and energy harvesting, they lag state-of-the-art lead-based materials in terms of performance. It is therefore important to develop new material designs to bridge this performance gap. Considering composites where rigid piezoelectric inclusions are embedded in soft matrices, a major cause of poor performance is weak coupling of applied strains to the inclusions. We show here that by designing matrices with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic matrices) it is possible to considerably improve this coupling. We first demonstrate this concept using a matrix which is inherently auxetic where we show an improvement of 40%–50% in the piezoelectric response. Based on the observations made, we develop a scalable design for auxetic matrices using conventional non-auxetic polymeric materials. This is done by embedding rigid auxetic structures in softer matrices. We show that with such designed auxetic matrices, which are amenable to fabrication through 3D printing, it is possible to achieve considerably larger piezoelectric response with a significant retention of the matrix softness. Particularly, we show that auxetic designs can show piezoelectric enhancements exceeding 300% compared to non-auxetic reference designs having similar a non-auxetic rigid backbone of similar volume as the auxetic backbone. Therefore, the use of matrices with negative Poisson's ratios is a promising design avenue to decouple mechanical coupling of strain to inclusions and matrix hardness. This strategy can pave way to design of softer piezocomposites with superior responses employing only structured polymeric materials without the use of expensive nanomaterials.\n\n",

    "abstract": "Improving the performance of lead-free piezocomposites to the levels of state-of-the-art lead-based composites has been an important challenge in composite research. Consequently, an important agenda of piezocomposite research has been to identify new coupled mechanisms that can enhance the piezoelectric response. One such method is to tap into the size-dependent flexoelectric phenomenon in geometrically anisotropic structures. Numerical models which can account for flexoelectricity and nonlinear effects such as electrostriction are not well-developed for piezocomposite design, and current designs are based on linear piezoelectric models. Here, we develop an advanced model with flexoelectric and electrostrictive contributions in geometrically tailored piezocomposites to obtain insights on aspects of enhanced response due to small-size effects. Here, based on design considerations, we numerically demonstrate that in epoxy-matrix-based piezocomposites which are structured as truncated pyramids, flexoelectricity can lead to significant enhancements in both the electric field and the electric flux generation at small length scales. Particularly, we show that at dilute inclusion concentrations, dramatic improvements nearing 150% in the piezoelectric response are possible. Further, the flexoelectric enhancement is sensitive to the packing of the inclusions within the composite structure with the best enhancements occurring when the inclusions are closer to the inclined edges of the pyramids. We also show that in composite structures with CNT-modified matrices, flexoelectricity produces similar enhancements as in the case of unmodified matrices, demonstrating that the effect operates almost independent of nanoscale elastic and dielectric modifications by the nanotubes. Finally, we also establish that for a large range of applied stresses, the nonlinear deviations in the response due to electrostriction are negligible and flexoelectricity is the predominant size-dependent enhancement mechanism in structured lead-free piezocomposites.\n",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous thermal ablation has proven to be an effective modality for treating both benign and malignant tumours in various tissues. Among these modalities, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most promising and widely adopted approach that has been extensively studied in the past decades. Microwave ablation (MWA) is a newly emerging modality that is gaining rapid momentum due to its capability of inducing rapid heating and attaining larger ablation volumes, and its lesser susceptibility to the heat sink effects as compared to RFA. Although the goal of both these therapies is to attain cell death in the target tissue by virtue of heating above 50°C, their underlying mechanism of action and principles greatly differs. Computational modelling is a powerful tool for studying the effect of electromagnetic interactions within the biological tissues and predicting the treatment outcomes during thermal ablative therapies. Such a priori estimation can assist the clinical practitioners during treatment planning with the goal of attaining successful tumour destruction and preservation of the surrounding healthy tissue and critical structures. This review provides current state-of-the-art developments and associated challenges in the computational modelling of thermal ablative techniques, viz., RFA and MWA, as well as touch upon several promising avenues in the modelling of laser ablation, nanoparticles assisted magnetic hyperthermia and non-invasive RFA. The application of RFA in pain relief has been extensively reviewed from modelling point of view. Additionally, future directions have also been provided to improve these models for their successful translation and integration into the hospital work flow.\n\n",

A comparative analysis was conducted for three different scenarios: (a) a completely homogeneous domain comprising of only muscle tissue, (b) a heterogeneous domain comprising of nerve and muscle tissues, and (c) a heterogeneous domain comprising of bone, nerve and muscle tissues. Finite-element-based simulations were performed to compute the temperature and electrical field distribution during conventional RF procedures for treating pain, and exemplified here for the continuous case. The predicted results reveal that the consideration of heterogeneity within the computational domain results in distorted electric field distribution and leads to a significant reduction in the attained ablation volume during the continuous RF application for pain relief. The findings of this study could provide first-hand quantitative information to clinical practitioners about the impact of such heterogeneities on the efficacy of RF procedures, thereby assisting them in developing standardized optimal protocols for different cases of interest.\n\n",

    "abstract": "Biological cells are exposed to a variety of mechanical loads throughout their life cycles that eventually play an important role in a wide range of cellular processes. The understanding of cell mechanics under the application of external stimuli is important for capturing the nuances of physiological and pathological events. Such critical knowledge will play an increasingly vital role in modern medical therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, as well as in the development of new remedial treatments. At present, it is well known that the biological molecules exhibit piezoelectric properties that are of great interest for medical applications ranging from sensing to surgery. In the current study, a coupled electro-mechanical model of a biological cell has been developed to better understand the complex behaviour of biological cells subjected to piezoelectric and flexoelectric properties of their constituent organelles under the application of external forces. Importantly, a more accurate modelling paradigm has been presented to capture the nonlocal flexoelectric effect in addition to the linear piezoelectric effect based on the finite element method. Major cellular organelles considered in the developed computational model of the biological cell are the nucleus, mitochondria, microtubules, cell membrane and cytoplasm. The effects of variations in the applied forces on the intrinsic piezoelectric and flexoelectric contributions to the electro-elastic response have been systematically investigated along with accounting for the variation in the coupling coefficients. In addition, the effect of mechanical degradation of the cytoskeleton on the electro-elastic response has also been quantified. The present studies suggest that flexoelectricity could be a dominant electro-elastic coupling phenomenon, exhibiting electric fields that are four orders of magnitude higher than those generated by piezoelectric effects alone. Further, the output of the coupled electro-mechanical model is significantly dependent on the variation of flexoelectric coefficients. We have found that the mechanical degradation of the cytoskeleton results in the enhancement of both the piezo and flexoelectric responses associated with electro-mechanical coupling. In general, our study provides a framework for more accurate quantification of the mechanical/electrical transduction within the biological cells that can be critical for capturing the complex mechanisms at cellular length scales.\n\n",

In particular, for the developed coarse-grained models with three bead approximations, we calculate the histograms for the bond angles and the dihedral angles. From the dihedral angle histograms, we analyze the characteristics of the links used to build the nanotubes. Furthermore, we also calculate the bead distances along the chains of RNA strands in the nanoclusters. The variations in these features with the size of the nanotube are discussed in detail. Finally, we present the results on the calculation of the root mean square deviations for a developed RNA nanotube to demonstrate the equilibration of the systems for drug delivery and other biomedical applications such as medical imaging and tissue engineering.",

During the photosynthesis process, the light photons are captured by the green chlorophyll pigments in their photosynthetic antennae and further funneled to the reaction center. One of the most important light harvesting complexes that are highly important in the study of photosynthesis is the membrane-attached Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex found in the green sulfur bacteria. In this review, we discuss the mathematical formulations and computational modeling of some of the light harvesting complexes including FMO. The most recent research developments in the photosynthetic light harvesting complexes are thoroughly discussed. The theoretical background related to the spectral density, quantum coherence and density functional theory has been elaborated. Furthermore, details about the transfer and excitation of energy in different sites of the FMO complex along with other vital photosynthetic light harvesting complexes have also been provided. Finally, we conclude this review by providing the current and potential applications in environmental science, energy, health and medicine, where such mathematical and computational studies of the photosynthesis and the light harvesting complexes can be readily integrated.",

In particular, the equations of the derivative expansion up to the ∂2 order for a scalar model are derived in a suitable form, clarifying the role of the off-diagonal terms in the matrix of functional derivatives. The natural domain of validity of the derivative expansion appears to be limited to small values of q/k in the calculation of the critical two-point correlation function, depending on the wave-vector magnitude q and the infrared cut-off scale k. The new approximation scheme has the advantage to be valid for any q/k, and, therefore, it can be auspicious in many current and potential applications of the celebrated Wetterich equation and similar models. Contrary to the derivative expansion, derivatives are not truncated at a finite order in the new scheme. The RG flow equations in the first approximation of this new scheme are derived and approximately solved as an example. It is shown that the derivative expansion up to the ∂2 order is just the small-q approximation of our new equations at the first order of truncation.",

The expressions are derived from orientational averages of third-order piezoelectric tensors of the individual crystals that are weighted by orientational distribution functions. The averaging is done by using generalized spherical harmonic series expansions. Improvements with respect to previous works in the literature are twofold: all crystal symmetries are considered and no symmetry restrictions are imposed to texture. The versatility of the introduced expressions is demonstrated on an example of BaTiO3 polycrystals with uniaxial and biaxial textures characterized by single and double Gaussian distributions, respectively. The results for uniaxial texture are in perfect agreement with the results published in the literature. The biaxial texture is discussed in detail and analyzed for a set of limiting cases.",

    "abstract": "The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.",

Here, we study the structure of simplicial complexes attached to eight global hubs in the female and male connectomes and identify the core networks among the affected brain regions. These eight hubs (Putamen, Caudate, Hippocampus and Thalamus-Proper in the left and right cerebral hemisphere) are the highest-ranking according to their topological dimension, defined as the number of simplexes of all orders in which the node participates. Furthermore, we analyse the weight-dependent heterogeneity of simplexes. We demonstrate changes in the structure of identified core networks and topological entropy when the threshold weight is gradually increased. These results highlight the role of higher-order interactions in human brain networks and provide additional evidence for (dis)similarity between the female and male connectomes.",

    "abstract": "Multiscale material design has made it possible to control the properties of a material through introducing structures at multiple length scales. This structuring brings about unusual material behaviour that is not seen in a continuum material. Here we introduce a multiscale design for the matrix components of a lead‐free piezocomposite. This combines a microscale stiff polymeric structure embedded within a softer matrix to form a composite matrix. By controlling the microscale features of the embedded structure, we tune the mechanical behaviour of the matrix by rendering it either nonauxetic (hexagonal structure) or auxetic (inverted hexagonal structure). Further, the mechanical and electrical properties of the matrix are controlled at the nanoscale by addition of carbon nanotubes within the embedded polymeric structure. By engineering the matrix at the nano and the microscale, we firstly demonstrate that the auxetic matrix can result in three orders of magnitude higher piezoelectric response by amplifying the strains within the piezoelectric inclusions. We further demonstrate that by using the matrix with the nonauxetic embedded structure, it is possible to design piezoelectric composites with pronounced anisotropy in their longitudinal and transverse responses. This is an important requirement for designing materials with directional sensing ability. Our findings show that the multiscale material design proposed here has important implications for both energy harvesting and directional sensing. Further, the approach taken here yields considerable performance improvements while using limited quantities of nanomaterial. The multiscale matrix design is scalable and amenable to fabrication through emerging methods such as additive manufacturing.",

The results are expressed in terms of local parameters, like streamline, isotherm, pressure coefficient, and local Nusselt number and global parameters, like wake length, drag coefficient, and average Nusselt number. The length of the recirculation zone on the rear side of the cylinder increases with the increasing value of Re and n. The effect of the total drag coefficient acting on the cylinder is seen to be higher at the low value of Re and its effect significant in shear-thinning fluids (n< 1). On the heat transfer aspect, the rate of heat transfer in fluids is increased by increasing the value of Re and Pr. The effect of heat transfer is enhanced in shear-thinning fluids up to∼ 40% and it impedes it’s to∼ 20% shear-thickening fluids. In the end, the numerical results of the total drag coefficient and average Nusselt number (in terms of JH−factor) have been correlated by simple expression to estimate the intermediate value for the new application.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale systems fabricated with low-dimensional nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, quantum dots, and more recently graphene sheets, have fascinated researchers from different fields due to their extraordinary and unique physical properties. For example, the remarkable mechanical properties of nanowires empower them to have a very high resonant frequency up to the order of giga to terahertz. In this paper, we originally propose a nonlinear model for the vibrations of piezoelectric nanowire resonators with added mass considering thermal variation, electromagnetic field, surface effects, external excitation, and nonlinear foundation. The mathematical model for such nanowires is formulated by applying the Euler– Bernoulli beam theory in conjunction with the nonlocal differential constitutive relations of Eringen type. In order to analyze the obtained nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), we first use the Galerkin method in combination with a perturbation technique to obtain the primary and super-harmonic resonances. After finding the resonance cases, a parametric sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of key parameters on the sensitivity of the nanowire resonators in mass sensing. Our main hypothesis is that tiny particles attached to the surface of the nanowire resonator would result in a detectable shift in the value of the jump frequency. The sensitivity analysis shows that the nanowire resonator is capable of detecting added mass in the order of zeptogram. In addition, we have developed a system identification technique based on the proposed mathematical model for the detection of tiny mass rested on the nanowire resonator that we have analyzed. Furthermore, a molecular dynamic simulation study has been presented to qualitatively verify the hypothesis of frequency shift due to the added mass. The results demonstrate a high potential of nanowire resonators in detecting tiny bio-particles such as DNA, RNA, proteins, viruses, and bacteria.",

The results are based on a developed mathematical model that combines: i) cell depolarization, ii) intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and iii) vesicular exocytosis. Furthermore, we have also investigated the possible role of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations of astrocytes. A modified Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal model has been used to describe the electrical activity of a depolarized neuron via membrane potential for initiation and propagation of action potentials. The intracellular Ca2+ dynamics have been modelled by coupling the neuronal electrical activity and Ca 2+mediated exocytosis, taking into account the high-voltage (L-type) and low-voltage (T-type) activated Ca2+ channels, plasma membrane, bulk cytosol and ER. The developed model has been extended to quantify the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes for investigating the effects of Aβ on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and astrocytes. A comparative analysis has been further conducted to quantify the effect of temperature on the Ca2+ dynamics mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and amyloid-beta in Alzheimer’s disease. This study have also accounted for the temperature threshold dependence on Ca2+ dynamics incorporating coldsensing neurons.

    "abstract": "The recent experience of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics spreading revealed the importance of passive forms of infection transmissions. Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and to unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes. The model accounts for each human actor’s susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.",

The objective of this study is to develop a fully coupled model of RF-assisted cardiac ablation, incorporating fluid-structure interaction (FSI), thermal relaxation time effects and porous media approach, for more accurate predictions of the treatment outcomes that could be easily translated into the treatment planning stage.\n\nMethods: Three-dimensional model of the cardiac ablation has been developed that comprises of the fragment of cardiac tissue, blood chamber and RF electrode. Cardiac tissue has been modeled as a porous media, surrounded by the blood flow within the cardiac chamber. The electric field distributions have been obtained utilizing the quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell’s equations. A non-Fourier based bio-heat transfer model has been used for predicting the temperature distribution and ablation zone during the cardiac ablation. The blood has been modeled as a Newtonian fluid and the velocity fields are obtained utilizing the Navier-Stokes equations. The thermal stresses induced due to the heating of the cardiac tissue have also been accounted by incorporating the solid mechanics module. The fully coupled electro-thermo-mechanical model has been solved utilizing a finite element based COMSOL Multiphysics software.\n\nResults: Parametric studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of cardiac tissue porosity, thermal relaxation time effects, electrode insertion depths and orientations on the treatment outcomes of the cardiac ablation. The results are presented in terms of predicted temperature distributions and ablation volumes for different cases of interest. It has been found that the electrode insertion depth and orientation has a significant effect on the treatment outcomes of cardiac ablation. Further, the porosity of the cardiac tissue also plays an important role in the prediction of temperature distribution and ablation volume during 2 RF-assisted cardiac ablation. Moreover, the thermal relaxation times effect only the treatment outcomes for shorter treatment times, less than 30 s.\n\nConclusions: The presented results would assist the clinicians in the treatment planning stage of the therapies by providing key quantitative information about the effect of critical factors on the efficacy of the cardiac ablation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs) are materials with strong nonlinearity, which will show hysteresis when it works. In the current paper, a differential model is proposed to describe the hysteresis in MSMAs caused by magnetic field induced martensite reorientation based on Landau theory of phase transitions. First, the three-dimensional model is simplified into a one-dimensional case, and the hysteresis in MSMAs is described by three martensite variant orientations. Then, a traditional Landau free energy is introduced, and the traditional Landau model is obtained by using the Euler–Lagrange equation. However, it is found that the prediction accuracy of the model is not ideal compared with the experimental data. Thus, an improved model is proposed, and the traditional Landau free energy is replaced by a function that can be determined by the easily measured physical quantities in the experimental curve. Numerical experiments show that the prediction effect of the improved model is much better than the traditional Landau model, and the stress dependence is also demonstrated. Moreover, the proposed improved model has the advantages for dynamic analysis and control with its differential form. Therefore, the frequency dependence of the improved model is demonstrated and a feedback linearization control methodology is proposed to make the system develops in the desired trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Studies of many complex systems have revealed new collective behaviours that emerge through the mechanisms of self-organised critical fluctuations. Subject to the external and endogenous driving forces, these collective states with long-range spatial and temporal correlations often arise from the intrinsic dynamics with the threshold nonlinearity and geometry-conditioned interactions. The self-similarity of critical fluctuations enables us to describe the system using fewer parameters and universal functions that, on the other hand, can simplify the computational and information complexity. Currently, the cutting-edge research on self-organised critical systems across the scales strives to formulate a unifying mathematical framework, utilise the critical universal properties in information theory, and decipher the role of hidden geometry. As a prominent example, we study the field-driven spin dynamics on the hysteresis loop in a network with higher-order structures described by simplicial complexes, which provides a geometric-frustration environment. While providing motivational illustrations from physical, biological, and social systems, along with their networks, we also demonstrate how the self-organised criticality occurs at the interplay of the complex topology and driving mode. This study opens up new promising routes with powerful tools to address a long-standing challenge in the theory and applications of complexity science ingrained in the efficient analysis of self-organised critical states under the competing higher-order interactions embedded in complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal models are ubiquitous in all branches of science and engineering, with a rapidly expanding range of mathematical and computational applications due to the ability of such models to capture effects and phenomena that traditional models cannot. While spatial nonlocalities have received considerable attention in the research community, the same cannot be said about nonlocality in time, in particular when nonlocal initial conditions are present. This paper aims at filling this gap, providing an overview of the current status of nonlocal models and focusing on the mathematical treatment of such models when nonlocal initial conditions are at the heart of the problem. Specifically, our representative example is given for a nonlocal-in-time problem for the abstract Schrödinger equation. By exploiting the linear nature of nonlocal conditions, we derive an exact representation of the solution operator under assumptions that the spectrum of Hamiltonian is contained in the horizontal strip of the complex plane. The derived representation permits us to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem’s well-posedness and the existence of its solution under different regularities. Furthermore, we present new sufficient conditions for the existence of the solution that extend the existing results in this field to the case when some nonlocal parameters are unbounded. Two further examples demonstrate the developed methodology and highlight the importance of its computer algebra component in the reduction procedures and parameter estimations for nonlocal models. Finally, a connection of the considered models and developed analysis is discussed in the context of other reduction techniques, concentrating on the most promising from the viewpoint of data-driven modelling environments, and providing directions for further generalizations.",

    "abstract": "In the current study, a 1-D phenomenological model is constructed to capture the temperature-induced hysteretic response in polycrystalline shape memory alloys (SMAs). The martensitic and austenitic transformations are regarded as the first-order transitions. A differential single-crystal model is formulated on the basis of Landau theory. It is assumed that the transformation temperatures follow the normal distribution among the grains due to the anisotropic stress field developed in the material. The polycrystalline hysteretic response is expressed as the integration of single-crystal responses. Besides, the prediction strategy for incomplete transitions is presented, and the first-order reversal curves are obtained via density reassignment. The proposed model is numerically implemented for validation. Comparisons between the modeling results and the experimental ones demonstrate the capability of the proposed model in addressing the hysteresis in thermally-induced phase transformations.",

    "abstract": "Auxeticity (negative Poisson’s ratio) is the unique mechanical property found in an extensive variety of materials, such as metals, graphene, composites, polymers, foams, fibers, ceramics, zeolites, silicates and biological tissues. The enhanced mechanical features of the auxetic materials have motivated scientists to design, engineer and manufacture man-made auxetic materials to fully leverage their capabilities in different fields of research applications, including aeronautics, medical, protective equipments, smart sensors, filter cleaning, and so on. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation is one of the most widely used methods for characterizing the mechanical properties and response of the living cells. In this contribution, we highlight main consequences of auxeticity for biosystems and provide a representative example to quantify the effect of nucleus auxeticity on the force response of the embryonic stem cells. A parametric study has been conducted on a heterogeneous stem cell to evaluate the effect of nucleus diameter, nucleus elasticity, indenter’s shape and location on the force-indentation curve. The developed model has also been validated with the recently reported experimental studies available in the literature. Our results suggest that the nucleus auxeticity plays a profound role in cell mechanics especially for large size nucleus. We also report the mechanical stresses induced within the hyperelastic cell model under different loading conditions that would be quite useful in decoding the interrelations between mechanical stimuli and cellular behavior of auxetic biosystems. Finally, current and potential areas of applications of our findings for regenerative therapies, tissue engineering, 3 D/4D bioprinting, and the development of meta-biomaterials are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can alleviate the movement disorders like Parkinson’s dis-ease (PD). Indeed, it is known that aberrant beta(13−30Hz)oscillations and the loss ofdopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia-thalamus (BGTH) and cortex characterize theakinesia symptoms of PD. However, the relevant biophysical mechanism behind this processstill remains unclear. Based on the prior striatal inhibitory model, we propose an extendedBGTH model incorporating medium spine neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons(FSIs) along with the effect of DBS. We are focusing in this paper on an open-loop DBSmode, where the stimulation parameters stay constant independent of variations in thedisease state, and modifications of parameters rely mainly on trial and error of medicalexperts. Additionally, we propose a novel combined model of the cerebellar-basal-gangliathalamocortical network, MSNs, and FSIs, and show new results that indicate that Parkin-sonian oscillations in the beta-band frequency range emerge from the dynamics of such anetwork. Our model predicts that DBS can be used to suppress beta oscillations in globuspallidus pars interna (GPi) neurons. This research will help our better understanding ofthe changes in brain activity caused by DBS, providing new insight for studying PD in thefuture.",

    "abstract": "Shape  memory  materials  have  been  playing  an  important  role  in  a  wide  range of  bioengineering  applications.   At  the  same  time,  recent  developments  of  graphene-based nanostructures,  such as nanoribbons,  have demonstrated that,  due to the unique properties of graphene, they can manifest superior electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical characteristics ideally suited for their potential usage for the next generation of diagnostic devices, drug delivery systems,  and  other  biomedical  applications.   One  of  the  most  intriguing  parts  of  these  new developments lies in the fact that certain types of such graphene nanoribbons can exhibit shape memory effects. In this paper, we apply machine learning tools to build an interatomic potential from  DFT  calculations  for  highly  ordered  graphene  oxide  nanoribbons,  a  material  that  had demonstrated  shape  memory  effects  with  a  recovery  strain  up  to  14.5%  for  2D  layers.   The graphene oxide layer can shrink to a metastable phase with lower constant lattice through the application of an electric field, and returns to the initial phase through an external mechanical force. The deformation leads to an electronic rearrangement and induces magnetization around the oxygen atoms. DFT calculations show no magnetization for sufficiently narrow nanoribbons, while the machine learning model can predict the suppression of the metastable phase for the same narrower nanoribbons. We can improve the prediction accuracy by analyzing only the evolution of the metastable phase, where no magnetization is found according to DFT calculations. The model developed here allows also us to study the evolution of the phases for wider nanoribbons, that would be computationally inaccessible through a pure DFT approach. Moreover, we extend our analysis to realistic systems that include vacancies and boron or nitrogen impurities at the oxygen atomic positions. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the current and potential applications of the materials exhibiting shape memory effects in bioengineering and biomedical fields.",

The coupled governing equations were solved for the given range of the pertinent dimensionless parameters of Rayleigh number (102 6 Ra 6 105 ), Prandtl number (10 6 Pr 6 100), and power-law index (0:3 6 n 6 1:8). At different orientation angles of the semicircular cylinders, the numerical results were visualized in terms of velocity and temperature profiles near the cylinder and, gross engineering parameters (e.g., average Nusselt numbers). If all other factors are equal, the rate of heat transfers from a semi-circular cylinder at u ¼ 90 is higher than for the other orientations. The rate of heat transfer can also be increased by increasing the value of Ra and decreasing the value of Pr. In the power-law fluids, the heat transfer rate is always higher in shear-thinning fluids under the same condition. In the end, the average Nusselt number for different orientation angles of the cylinder has been correlated by simple expression.",

In contrast, the average Nusselt number decreases as the value of the Bingham number increases from its maximum value in Newtonian media to its conduction limit when most of the fluid is frozen..

Based on first-principles calculations, results show that pristine unstrained 7aGNRsH is electrically nonconductive but turns to be electrically conductive in a wide range of energy spectrum, e.g., from IR to visible to UV, due to the application of strain engineering. In metallic unstrained and strained 7aGNRsH-B and 7aGNRsH-V, non-vanishing electrical conductivity in the IR, visible and UV energy spectrum regimes are observed. We also investigate the influence of strain on the Berry curvature of 7aGNRsH, 7aGNRsH-B and 7aGNRsH-V nanoribbons. The results show that fermions are spread through out the Brillouin zone in the reciprocal space for semiconducting unstrained 7aGNRsH but localized near the 𝛤-point for strained 7aGNRsH that have out-of-plane deformations due to strain engineering. For metallics 7aGNRsH-B and 7aGNRsH-V, Berry curvature plots show that fermions are localized far away from the 𝛤-point. In two atom boron doped p-type armchair graphene nanoribbons with 7 zigzag edges (7aGNRsH-2B), large peaks in electrical conductivity at IR energy spectrum regimes can be observed. These peaks of electrical conductivities in 7aGNRSH-2B may be detectable in experimentally synthesized structure in Cloke et al. (2015).",

    "abstract": "Low-dimensional nanostructures have many advantages when used in sensors compared to the traditional bulk materials, in particular in their sensitivity and specificity. In such nanostructures, the motion of carriers can be confined from one, two, or all three spatial dimensions, leading to their unique properties. New advancements in nanosensors, based on low-dimensional nanostructures, permit their functioning at scales comparable with biological processes and natural systems, allowing their efficient functionalization with chemical and biological molecules. In this article, we provide details of such sensors, focusing on their several important classes, as well as the issues of their designs based on mathematical and computational models covering a range of scales. Such multiscale models require state-of-the-art techniques for their solutions, and we provide an overview of the associated numerical methodologies and approaches in this context. We emphasize the importance of accounting for coupling between different physical fields such as thermal, electromechanical, and magnetic, as well as of additional nonlinear and nonlocal effects which can be salient features of new applications and sensor designs. Our special attention is given to nanowires and nanotubes which are well suited for nanosensor designs and applications, being able to carry a double functionality, as transducers and the media to transmit the signal. One of the key properties of these nanostructures is an enhancement in sensitivity resulting from their high surface-to-volume ratio, which leads to their geometry-dependant properties. This dependency requires careful consideration at the modelling stage, and we provide further details on this issue. Another important class of sensors analyzed here is pertinent to sensor and actuator technologies based on smart materials. The modelling of such materials in their dynamics-enabled applications represents a significant challenge as we have to deal with strongly nonlinear coupled problems, accounting for dynamic interactions between different physical fields and microstructure evolution. Among other classes, important in novel sensor applications, we have given our special attention to heterostructures and nucleic acid based nanostructures. In terms of the application areas, we have focused on chemical and biomedical fields, as well as on green energy and environmentally-friendly technologies where the efficient designs and opportune deployments of sensors are both urgent and compelling",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD) are associated with the propagation and aggregation of toxic proteins. In the case of AD, it was Alzheimer himself who showed the importance of both amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in what he called the “disease of forgetfulness”. The amyloid beta forms extracellular aggregates and plaques, whereas tau proteins are intracellular proteins that stabilize axons by cross-linking microtubules that can form largely messy tangles. On the other hand, astrocytes and microglial cells constantly clear these plaques and NFTs from the brain. Astrocytes transport nutrients from the blood to neurons. Activated astrocytes produce monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which attracts anti-inflammatory macrophages and clears Aβ. At the same time, the microglia cells are poorly phagocytic for Aβ compared to proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages. In addition to such distinctive neuropathological features of AD as amyloid beta and tau proteins, neuroinflammation has to be brought into the picture as well. Taking advantage of a coupled mathematical modelling framework, we formulate a network model, accounting for the coupling between neurons and astroglia and integrating all three main neuropathological features with the brain connectome data. We provide details on the coupled dynamics involving cytokines, astrocytes, and microglia. Further, we apply the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor and anti-Aβ drug and analyze their influence on the brain cells, suggesting conditions under which the drug can prevent cell damage. The important role of astrocytes and TNF-α inhibitors in AD pathophysiology is emphasized, along with potentially promising pathways for developing new AD therapies.",

    "abstract": "In this research, the propulsion of the proposed jellyfish-inspired mantle undulated propulsion robot (MUPRo) is optimized. To reliably predict the hydrodynamic forces acting on the robot, the proposed nonintrusive reduced-order model (NIROM) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) additionally considers the POD basis that makes an important contribution to the features on the specified boundary. The proposed model establishes a mapping between the parameter-driven motion of the mantle and the evolution of the fluid characteristics around the swimmer. Moreover, to predict new cases where the input needs to be updated, the input of the proposed model is taken from the kinematics of the robot rather than extracted from full-order high-fidelity models. In this paper, it takes approximately 950 s to perform a simulation using the full-order high-fidelity model. However, the computational cost for one prediction with the proposed POD-NIROM is around 0.54 s, of which about 0.2 s is contributed by preprocessing. Compared with the NIROM based on the classic POD method, the proposed POD-NIROM can effectively update the input and reasonably predict the characteristics on the boundary. The analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the MUPRo pinpoints that, over a certain period and with a certain undulation amplitude, the hydrodynamic force generated by the swinging-like mantle motion (k < 0.5) is greater, outperforming Aequorea victoria in startup acceleration. It is demonstrated that considering a certain power loss and a certain tail beat amplitude, the wave-like mantle motion (k > 0.5) can produce greater propulsion, which means higher propulsion efficiency.",

In the nervous system, the brain states translate collective activities of neurons interconnected via synaptic connections. In this paper, we study coupled effects of channels and synaptic dynamics under the stochastic influence of healthy brain cells with applications to Parkinson’s disease (PD). In particular, we investigate the effects of random inputs in a subthalamic nucleus (STN) cell membrane potential model. The STN bursting phenomena and parkinsonian hypokinetic motor symptoms are closely connected, as electrical and chemical maneuvers modulating STN bursts are sufficient to ameliorate or mimic parkinsonian motor deficits. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN is an important surgical technique used in the treatment to improve PD symptoms. Our numerical results show that the random inputs strongly affect the spiking activities of the STN neuron not only in the case of healthy cells but also in the case of PD cells in the presence of DBS treatment. Specifically, the existence of a random refractory period together with random input current in the system may substantially influence an increased irregularity of spike trains of the output neurons.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used successfully as symptomatic treatment in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the mechanisms of its activity inside the brain network are unclear. Many virtual DBS models investigate the dynamics of a subnetwork surrounding the basal ganglia (BG) as a spiking network has been attracting a growing body of research in neuroscience. Connectomic data, on the other hand, show that DBS has a wide range of impacts on many distinct cortical and subcortical sites. Notably, the nonlinear reaction–diffusion multiscale mathematical models demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing crucial disease characteristics and are used to simulate large-scale brain activity. The BG and associated nuclei comprise many subcortical cell groups in the brain, and their couplings commonly revealed MRI-based assessments of the strength of anatomical connections. We have developed a hybrid modeling formalism and a unique co-simulation technique that allows us to compute electrodiffusive ion dynamics for the cortex–BG–thalamus (BGTH) brain network model within a large-scale brain connectome. We collect data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and propose a closed-loop DBS approach based on the brain network model. Moreover, we select regions in the parameter space that reflect the healthy and Parkinsonian states as well as the impact of DBS on the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons. We predicted that if we apply the DBS to the system described by the temporal model, the brain maintains a healthy state until 0.05ms for STN neurons and 0.035ms for GPi neurons. A local regulatory mechanism known as feedback inhibition control (FIC) points to the existence of underlying network dynamics in the white matter of connected brain regions. The model showed unanticipated effects that in the presence of diffusion, the human brain maintained a healthy state for a long time after the DBS had been applied to STN and GPi neurons. This research helps us better understand the changes in brain activity caused by DBS and enhances this clinical therapy, thus shedding new light on the importance of DBS mechanisms in BGTH brain network models of neurodegenerative disorders.",

The streamlines, isotherm contours, yield surfaces, local and average Nusselt numbers were analysed and discussed. It is found that as the aspect ratio of the enclosure increases from 0.5 to 0.9, the average Nusselt number on the surface of the hot cylinder increases as a larger amount of fluid takes part in convection. Moreover, at sufficiently large Bingham numbers, yield stress forces dominate over buoyancy causing the flow to cease and thus the Nusselt number approaches its conduction limit. Finally, the Nusselt number approaches its conduction limit once the maximum Bingham number is reached.",

These modeling efforts and analysis have assisted in a better understanding of the intricacies of associated biological phenomena and factors that affect the treatment outcomes of hyperthermic therapeutic procedures. In this contribution, we report a three-dimensional non-Fourier bio-heat transfer model of cardiac ablation that accounts for the three-phase-lags (TPL) in the heat propagation, viz., lags due to heat flux, temperature gradient, and thermal displacement gradient. Finite element-based COMSOL Multiphysics software has been utilized to predict the temperature distributions and ablation volumes. A comparative analysis has been conducted to report the variation in the treatment outcomes of cardiac ablation considering different bio-heat transfer models. The effect of variations in the magnitude of different phase lags has been systematically investigated. The fidelity and integrity of the developed model have been evaluated by comparing the results of the developed model with the analytical results of the recent studies available in the literature. This study demonstrates the importance of considering non-Fourier lags within biological tissue for predicting more accurately the characteristics important for the efficient application of thermal therapies.",

While a number of medical devices have been developed for the detection, prevention, and treatments of such disorders, some fundamentals of the progression of associated diseases are in urgent need of further clarifcation. In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer’s disease, where it is believed that the concentration changes in amyloid-beta and tau proteins play a central role in its onset and development. A multiscale model is proposed to analyze the propagation of these concentrations in the brain connectome. In particular, we consider a modifed heterodimer model for the protein–protein interactions. Higher toxic concentrations of amyloid-beta and tau proteins destroy the brain cell. We have studied these propagations for the primary and secondary and their mixed tauopathies. We model the damage of a brain cell by the nonlocal contributions of these toxic loads present in the brain cells. With the help of rigorous analysis, we check the stability behaviour of the stationary points corresponding to the homogeneous system. After integrating the brain connectome data into the developed model, we see that the spreading patterns of the toxic concentrations for the whole brain are the same, but their concentrations are diferent in diferent regions. Also, the time to propagate the damage in each region of the brain connectome is diferent..",

To unravel the global features of these processes, we analyse the world data of SARS-CoV-2 infection events, scrutinising two 8- month periods associated with the epidemic’s outbreak and initial immunisation phase. Based on the correlation-network mapping, K-means clustering, and multifractal time series analysis, our results reveal several universal patterns of infection dynamics, suggesting potential predominant drivers of the pandemic. More precisely, the Laplacian eigenvectors localisation has revealed robust communities of different countries and regions that break into clusters according to similar profiles of infection fluctuations. Apart from quantitative measures, the immunisation phase differs significantly from the epidemic outbreak by the countries and regions constituting each cluster. While the similarity grouping possesses some regional components, the appearance of large clusters spanning different geographic locations is persevering. Furthermore, characteristic cyclic trends are related to these clusters; they dominate large temporal fluctuations of infection evolution, which are prominent in the immunisation phase. Meanwhile, persistent fluctuations around the local trend occur in intervals smaller than 14 days. These results provide a basis for further research into the interplay between biological and social factors as the primary cause of infection cycles and a better understanding of the impact of socio-economical and environmental factors at different phases of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Wetterich exact renormalization group (RG) equation. Approximate closed equations are obtained from it, applying certain truncation schemes for the effective average action. These equations are solved either purely numerically or by certain extra truncations for the potential and related quantities, called the functional truncations. Traditionally, the functional truncations consist of truncated expansions in powers of $\\tilde{\\rho}-\\tilde{\\rho}_0$, where $\\tilde{\\rho} \\propto \\phi^2$, φ is the averaged order parameter, and $\\tilde{\\rho}_0$ corresponds to the minimum of the dimensionless potential $u_k(\\tilde{\\rho})$, depending on the infrared cut-off scale k. We propose a new approach of functional truncations, using the expansion $u_k(\\tilde{\\rho})- u_k(0) = (1-s)^{-\\mu} \\left(u_{1,k}s + u_{2,k}s^2 + \\cdots \\right)$, where $s = \\tilde{\\rho}/(\\tilde{\\rho}_0+\\tilde{\\rho})$, $\\tilde{\\rho}_0$ is an optimization parameter and µ is the exponent, describing the $\\tilde{\\rho} \\to \\infty$ asymptotic. The newly developed method provides accurate estimates of the critical exponents η, ν and also ω. In the case of the local potential approximation (LPA), the discrepancy with the purely numerical solution is $0.000\\,15$ for ν and 0.0012 for ω at the s13 order of truncation. We show that this method is advantageous for estimations beyond the LPA, especially, for the critical exponent ω. In particular, we have obtained $\\eta = 0.0454(1)$, $\\nu = 0.6292(2)$, and $\\omega = 0.8606(30)$ for the equation originally derived in 2020 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53 415002 within a new truncation scheme for the effective action. The approach can also be used for the solution of other nonperturbative RG models that have a broad range of applications.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a 2D phenomenological model to characterize the magneto-mechanical coupled behavior and its temperature dependences for martensitic variant reorientation in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys. A set of state variables are chosen to describe diferent microscopic mechanisms, and the evolution rules for the state variables are determined by minimizing the thermodynamic potential. The modifed Landau free energy function is employed to account for the hysteretic switching between martensitic variants. It is assumed that the local switching thresholds are distributed due to the nonuniform internal stress throughout the specimen. The governing equation for martensite reorientation is then homogenized by taking this distribution property into account. The concept of density reassignment is also deployed to improve the modeling accuracy for partial reorientations. To validate the model capability, the model formulation is numerically implemented for the typical loading condition (i.e., uniaxial stress and a perpendicular magnetic feld). As one of the superiorities, the temperature-dependent properties are remarked for the proposed model as well. Comparisons between the model predictions and the experimental results demonstrate the model capability in addressing the magneto-mechanical couplings and the temperature dependences of martensite reorientation.",

Our estimated values of the correction-to-scaling exponent ω tend to decrease below the usually accepted value about 0.83 when the smallest lattice sizes are discarded from the fits. This behavior apparently confirms some of the known estimates of the Monte Carlo renormalization group (MCRG) method, i. e., ω ≈ 0.7 and ω = 0.75(5). We discuss the possibilities that ω is either really smaller than usually expected or these values of ω describe some transient behavior. We propose refining MCRG simulations and analysis to resolve this issue. In distinction from ω, our actual MC estimations of the critical exponents η and ν provide stable values η = 0.03632(13) and ν = 0.63017(31), which well agree with those of the conformal bootstrap method, i. e., η = 0.0362978(20) and ν = 0.6299709(40).",

    "abstract": "In many complex systems, self-organised criticality (SOC) provides a mechanism for the diversity of spatiotemporal scales that optimises the system’s response to omnipresent driving forces. Signatures of SOC are increasingly more evidenced in collective social behaviours. However, the spontaneous occurrence of critical states and their role in maintaining the system’s functional properties still need to be better understood; the reason can be related to the complexity of human interactions and the ubiquitous presence of cycles in social dynamics. In this work, we shed new light on these issues based on a critical survey and the extensive data analysis of online social dynamics. Firstly, we highlight prominent features of human activity patterns, conditioned by circadian cycles and content-related interactions, that can affect the course of the dynamics from the elemental to the global scale. We then analyse the prototypal time series of emotion-driven communications in the online social network MySpace to demonstrate the coexistence of SOC states with the modulated cyclical trends. Precisely, we determine avalanches of emotional comments exhibiting multifractal scaling, scale-invariant inter-avalanching behaviours and temporal correlations coexist with the cyclical trends of broad singularity spectra. We demonstrate that similar multi-harmonic cycles occur in entirely different datasets, particularly the negative emotion-driven Diggs and the infection-rate data from recent epidemics. Our results reveal the dynamical regime where the modulated cycles coexist with self-organised critical states; in contrast, in the cycles-dominated regime, exemplified by the infection time series, the nature of collective dynamics remains hidden behind the cycle modulation.",

We propose a model based on a coupled system of reflecting Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations with jump-like exit from a boundary. The setting describes the population dynamics of active and passive populations. As main working techniques, we use compactness methods and Skorokhod's representation of solutions to SDEs posed in bounded domains to prove the well-posedness of the system. This functional setting is a new point of view in the field of modeling and simulation of population dynamics. We provide the details of the model, as well as representative numerical examples, and discuss the applications of a Wilson–Cowan-type system, modeling the dynamics of two interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, the presence of random input current, reflecting factors together with Poisson jumps, increases firing activity in neuronal systems.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is the most complicated biological structure on the planet. A major challenge of brain network modelling lies in its multi-scale spatio-temporal nature, covering scales from synapses to the whole brain. The coupled multiphysics and biochemical activities which spread through such a complex system shape brain capacity inside a structure-function relationship that requires a particular mathematical framework. Next-generation coupled-based mathematical modelling approaches to brain networks and the analysis of data-driven dynamical systems are needed to advance state-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that affect millions of people worldwide, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Importantly, AD is marked by the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau (τ ) proteins. Some disease-specific misfolded proteins can interact with healthy proteins to form long chains and aggregates of different sizes that have different transport properties and toxicity. An improved large-scale brain network model is proposed here to understand the pathogenesis of AD, especially the role of astrocytes in the presence of misfolded proteins (Aβ and τ ). The idea involves astrocytic clearance, which assists in eliminating toxic Aβ via fragmentation. We use the general Smoluchowski theory of nucleation, aggregation, and fragmentation to predict the development and propagation of aggregates of misfolded proteins in the brain. It has been shown that the developed model leads to different size distributions and propagation along the network. We predicted that astrocytic clearance varies with the aggregate size, which is key to slowing down AD progression. The clearance and fragmentation of toxic proteins span several spatial and temporal scales, and this research will potentially yield new insight into the associated processes and brain networks in health and disease. Detailed multi-scale brain modelling provides a promising approach for consolidating, organizing, and bridging the data sets of data-driven brain network models.",

By using the Feynman disentangling operators method, we calculate the spin-flip probability of qubit driven by different kinds of composite pulses, e.g., Constant pulse (C-pulse), Quantum Well pulse (QW-pulse), and Barrier Potential pulse (BP-pulse) in the presence of RTN. When composite pulses and RTN act in the x-direction and z-direction respectively, we calculate the optimal time to achieve perfect spin-flip probability of qubit. We report that the highest fidelity of spin-flip qubit can be achieved by using C-pulse, followed by BP-pulse and QW-pulse. For a more general case, we have tested several pulse sequences for achieving high fidelity quantum gates, where we use the pulses acting in different directions. From the calculations, we find that high fidelity of qubit gate operation in the presence of RTN is achieved when QW-pulse, BP-pulse, and C-pulse act in the x-direction, y-direction, and z-direction, respectively. We extend our investigations for multiple QW and BP pulses while choosing the C-pulse amplitude constant in the presence of RTN. The results of calculation show that 98:5% fidelity can be achieved throughout the course of RTN that may be beneficial for quantum error correction.",

Here, we investigate two design proposals to introduce flexoelectric enhancement in lead-free piezocomposites using an advanced electro-elastic model that incorporates piezoelectric and flexoelectric couplings. The first idea involves introducing anisotropy into the composite structure through a graded inclusion concentration. The second idea involves introducing porosity in the matrix to create structural anisotropy.

Using a complex systems perspective, we combine network mapping with K-means clustering and multifractal detrended fluctuations analysis to identify typical trends in fatality rate data. We analyse global data of (normalised) fatality time series recorded during the first two years of the recent pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as an appropriate example. Our results reveal six clusters with robust patterns of mortality progression that represent specific adaptations to prevailing biological factors. They make up two significant groups that coincide with the topological communities of the correlation network, with stabilising (group g1) and continuously increasing rates (group g2). Strong cyclic trends and multifractal small-scale fluctuations around them characterise these patterns. The rigorous analysis and the proposed methodology shed more light on the complex nonlinear shapes of the pandemic’s main characteristic curves, which have been discussed extensively in the literature regarding the global infectious diseases that have affected humanity throughout its history. In addition to better pandemic preparedness in the future, the presented methodology can also help to differentiate and predict other trends in pandemics, such as fatality rates, caused simultaneously by different viruses in particular geographic locations.",

Crystallites can belong to any class of cubic symmetry or to the tetragonal TI Laue group, while no restriction is imposed on texture symmetry. These expressions are reduced to very simple ones when cubic crystallites with fiber texture are considered. The proposed formulation provides information on the matrix structure of the homogenized material related to the crystallographic symmetry and texture. We close with some illustrative examples.",

    "abstract": "We consider the non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) equations, obtained as approximations of the exact Wetterich RG flow equation within the Blaizot–Mendez–Wschebor (BMW) truncation scheme. For the first time, we derive explicit RG flow equations for the scalar model at the arbitrary order of truncation. Moreover, we consider original, as well as modified, approximations, used to obtain a set of closed equations. We compare these equations at the s = 2 order of truncation with those recently derived in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53, 415002 (2020) within a new truncation scheme and find a striking similarity. Namely, the first-order equations of the latter scheme, those of the original BMW scheme, and those of the modified BMW scheme (at s = 2) differ only in one term. We solved these equations by a recently proposed and tested method of semi-analytic approximations. Thus, the critical exponents η, ν, and ω were evaluated, recovering also the known results of the original BMW scheme. In addition, we estimated the subleading correction-to-scaling exponent ω2 for the three equations considered. To the best of our knowledge, this exponent has not yet been extracted from the Wetterich equation beyond the local potential (the zeroth order) approximation. Our current estimate for the 3D Ising model is ω2 = 2.02 (40), where the error bars include the expected truncation error in the BMW scheme.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a deep learning based framework has been developed to predict hydrodynamic forces on a mantle-undulated propulsion robot (MUPRo). A multiple proper orthogonal decomposition (MPOD) algorithm has been proposed to efficiently identify fluid features near the undulating mantle of the MUPRo globally and locally. The results indicate that the  error of the solution states near the undulating boundary of the proposed MPOD algorithm converges almost linearly to 0.2%. Furthermore, a hydrodynamics prediction framework has been developed based on the proposed MPOD algorithm, where a long short-term memory neural network predicts the temporal coefficients of the MPOD spatial modes. The developed framework achieves economical and reliable predictions of hydrodynamic forces acting on the undulating boundary compared to simulations and experiments. Moreover, the  error of the developed framework is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the frameworks based on the classical POD algorithm when the degrees of freedom are consistent. Finally, the reliability of the proposed MPOD-NIROM is discussed through an offline parameter planning case of an aquatic-inspired robot. The model presented in this paper can provide support for the offline parameter planning of aquatic-inspired robots.",

Therefore, the current study is to assess the impact of the Darcy parameter (Da), nanoparticle volume fraction (ϕ), and Reynolds number (Re) on the momentum transport characteristics over the 45° inclined porous square cylinder. The governing equations were solved numerically using the Darcy–Brinkman–Forchheimer model for different values of Da ( ), nanoparticle volume fraction ϕ ( ), and Reynolds number Re ( ). The results for each parameter were visualized using streamline plots, velocity profiles within the porous cylinder, and vorticity contours. Complex flow behaviors were observed between Da = 10−3–10−2, flow separation detached and disappeared at the cylinder's downstream side at critical Darcy number. Drag and pressure coefficents are used to represent the global and local parameter of the flow fields. The pressure coefficient on the surface of the cylinder showed an inverse relationship with the nanoparticles volume fraction and Darcy number. The strength of the drag coefficient decreased with the addition of nanoparticles to the base fluid, with a decreasing trend observed for Da = 10−4–10−2 and no change observed for Da = 10−6–10−4. At last, the comparative analysis has been conducted between a porous square cylinder at 0° inclined and another 45° inclined.",

Notably, in this work, the temperature-dependent thermal properties of brain tissue have been considered. The developed model has been validated by comparing the temperature obtained from the numerical and ex vivo brain tissue during interstitial laser ablation. The ex vivo brain model has been further extended to in vivo settings by incorporating the blood perfusion effects. The results of the systematic analysis highlight the importance of considering temperature-dependent thermal properties of the brain tissue, non-Fourier behavior, and microvascular perfusion effects in the computational models for accurate predictions of the treatment outcomes during interstitial laser ablation, thereby minimizing the damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

Significant research efforts have been devoted in the past to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms driving deposition and dysregulation. Importantly, synaptic impairments, neuronal loss, and cognitive failure in AD patients are all related to the buildup of intraneuronal accumulation. Moreover, increasing evidence show a feed-forward loop between and levels, that is, disrupts neuronal levels, which in turn affects the formation of . To better understand this interaction, we report a novel stochastic model where we analyze the positive feedback loop between and using ADNI data. A good therapeutic treatment plan for AD requires precise predictions. Stochastic models offer an appropriate framework for modeling AD since AD studies are observational in nature and involve regular patient visits. The etiology of AD may be described as a multi-state disease process using the approximate Bayesian computation method. So, utilizing ADNI data from -year visits for AD patients, we employ this method to investigate the interplay between and levels at various disease development phases. Incorporating the ADNI data in our physics-based Bayesian model, we discovered that a sufficiently large disruption in either metabolism or intracellular homeostasis causes the relative growth rate in both and , which corresponds to the development of AD. The imbalance of ions causes disorders by directly or indirectly affecting a variety of cellular and subcellular processes, and the altered homeostasis may worsen the abnormalities of ion transportation and deposition. This suggests that altering the balance or the balance between and by chelating them may be able to reduce disorders associated with AD and open up new research possibilities for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "In functionally complex systems, higher order connectivity is often revealed in the underlying geometry of networked units. Furthermore, such systems often show signatures of self-organised criticality, a specific type of non-equilibrium collective behaviour associated with an attractor of internal dynamics with long-range correlations and scale invariance, which ensures the robust functioning of complex systems, such as the brain. Here, we highlight the intertwining of features of higher order geometry and self-organised critical dynamics as a plausible mechanism for the emergence of new properties on a larger scale, representing the central paradigm of the physical notion of complexity. Considering the time-scale of the structural evolution with the known separation of the time-scale in self-organised criticality, i.e., internal dynamics and external driving, we distinguish three classes of geometries that can shape the self-organised dynamics on them differently. We provide an overview of current trends in the study of collective dynamics phenomena, such as the synchronisation of phase oscillators and discrete spin dynamics with higher order couplings embedded in the faces of simplicial complexes. For a representative example of self-organised critical behaviour induced by higher order structures, we present a more detailed analysis of the dynamics of field-driven spin reversal on the hysteresis loops in simplicial complexes composed of triangles. These numerical results suggest that two fundamental interactions representing the edge-embedded and triangle-embedded couplings must be taken into account in theoretical models to describe the influence of higher order geometry on critical dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Pattern formation is a visual understanding of the dynamics of complex systems. Patterns arise in many ways, such as the segmentation of animals, bacterial colonies during growth, vegetation, chemical reactions, etc. In most cases, long-range diffusion occurs, and the usual reaction-diffusion (RD) model cannot capture such phenomena. The nonlocal RD model, on the other hand, can fill the gap. Analytical derivation of the amplitude equations (AE) for an RD system is a valuable tool to predict the pattern selections, particularly the stationary Turing patterns when they occur. In this paper, we analyze the conditions for the Turing bifurcation for the nonlocal model and derive the AE for the nonlocal RD model near the Turing bifurcation threshold to describe the reason behind the pattern selections. This derivation of the AE is not only limited to the nonlocal prey-predator model, as shown in our representative example, but also can be applied to other nonlocal models near the Turing bifurcation threshold. The analytical prediction agrees with numerical simulation near the Turing bifurcation threshold. Moreover, the analytical and numerical results fit each other well, even more remote from the Turing bifurcation threshold for the small values of the nonlocal parameter but not for the higher values.",

This phenomenon can significantly enhance piezocomposite response in addition to linear piezoelectricity. This enhancement is especially important for lead-free piezocomposites, which generally underperform compared to lead-based counterparts. Flexoelectric enhancement is facilitated by structural anisotropy in piezocomposites. However, challenges in modeling flexoelectric effects arise from several unknowns. Firstly, the shear flexoelectric coefficient is not well-characterized experimentally. Secondly, significant discrepancies exist between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of flexoelectric coefficients. Thirdly, the influence of matrix mechanical properties on flexoelectric behavior is poorly understood. To address these issues, we construct a parametric flexoelectric model of a lead-free piezocomposite with graded inclusion concentration. We then systematically analyze the impact of each parameter to identify which significantly influence flexoelectric behavior.

However, it is essential to note that the progress in high-temperature haptic applications is still in the developmental phase. Due to their complex phase and domain structures, lead-free piezoelectric materials such as (BNT)-based haptic technology behave differently at high temperatures than in ambient conditions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the aspects of thermal management and thermal stability, as temperature plays a vital role in the phase and domain transition of BNT material. A two-dimensional thermo-electromechanical model has been proposed in this study to analyze the thermal stability of the BNT-PDMS composite by analyzing the impact of temperature on effective electromechanical properties and mechanical and electric field parameters. However, the thermo-electromechanical modelling of the BNT-PDMS composite examines the macroscopic effects of the applied thermal field on mechanical and electric field parameters, as phase change and microdomain dynamics are not considered in this model. This study analyzes the impact of thermo-electromechanical coupling on the performance of the BNT-PDMS composite compared to conventional electromechanical coupling. The results predicted a significant improvement in piezoelectric response compared to electromechanical coupling due to the increased thermoelectric effect in the absence of phase change and microdomain switching for temperature boundary conditions below depolarization temperature (C for pure BNT material).",

In this study, we investigate the isotropic and anisotropic behavior of phonon-mediated spin relaxation of heavy-hole spin hot spots in QDs. For the electron spin in isotropic QDs, hot spots are known to be always present due to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. But for heavy holes in isotropic dots, we show that the occurrences of spin hot spots are sensitive to the bulk  g  factor. The hot spot for Rashba coupling in InAs and GaSb dots arises because these materials possess negative bulk  g  factor, while that for the Dresselhaus coupling in GaAs and InSb dots is found due to their positive bulk  g  factor. For anisotropic QDs, on the other hand, the spin hot spot is universally present due to their broken in-plane rotational symmetry. Further, the increasing electric field, that strengthens the Rashba coupling, is shown to cover a wide range of magnetic field by the hot spots. Results demonstrate that the magnetic field, choice of dot materials, and size anisotropy can act as effective control parameters, which can be experimentally used to design the device for detecting the phonon-mediated heavy-hole spin-relaxation behavior of III-V semiconductor QDs.",

Understanding the causes and effects of these patterns is critical for long-term land surface management and conservation efforts in semiarid regions, which are especially sensitive to climate change and human-caused disturbances. In addition, developing mathematical models is challenging because of the involvement of several interacting components within an ecosystem. It is known that there is a regular connection between the vegetation and the living species in a habitat since some animals evolved to live in a semiarid ecosystem and rely on plants for food. In this work, we have constructed a coupled mathematical model to connect the water resource, vegetation, and living organisms and have investigated how the soil surface affects the resulting patterns in the long term. This study contributes to a better understanding of ecological patterns and processes in semiarid environments by shedding light on the complex interaction mechanisms that depend on the structure of semiarid ecosystems. For example, the impact of intensive rainfall on ecosystem dynamics can be profound, triggering critical transitions and leading to significant yield loss. The energy lost as it moves from one trophic level to the next, the potential for diversity to exacerbate species extinction rates, and the role of water flow in driving the system towards more robust stripe pattern formations are all significant factors. Despite these complexities, the findings offer critical insights into the influence of efforts to enhance ecosystem resilience and adapt to the challenges of climate change and human activities.",

    "abstract": "Living tissues experience various external forces on cells, influencing their behaviour, physiology, shape, gene expression, and destiny through interactions with their environment. Despite much research done in this area, challenges remain in our better understanding of the behaviour of the cell in response to external stimuli, including the arrangement, quantity, and shape of organelles within the cell. This study explores the electromechanical behaviour of biological cells, including organelles like microtubules, mitochondria, nuclei, and cell membranes. A two-dimensional bio-electromechanical model for two distinct cell structures has been developed to analyze the behavior of the biological cell to the external electrical and mechanical responses. The piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects have been included via multiphysics coupling for the biological cell. All the governing equations have been discretized and solved by the finite element method. It is found that the longitudinal stress is absent and only the transverse stress plays a crucial role when the mechanical load is imposed on the top side of the cell through compressive displacement. The impact of flexoelectricity is elucidated by introducing a new parameter called the maximum electric potential ratio (). It has been found that  depends upon the orientation angle and shape of the microtubules. The magnitude of exhibit huge change when we change the shape and orientation of the organelles, which in some cases (boundary condition (BC)-3) can reach to three times of regular shape organelles. Further, the study reveals that the number of microtubules significantly impacts effective elastic and piezoelectric coefficients, affecting cell behavior based on structure, microtubule orientation, and mechanical stress direction. The insight obtained from the current study can assist in advancements in medical therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

If corrections have the form  ∝ L−ω, then we find ω = 1.546(30) and ω = 1.509(14) as the best estimates. These are obtained from the finite-size scaling of the susceptibility data in the range of linear lattice sizes L ∈ [128, 2048] at the critical value of the Binder cumulant and from the scaling of the corresponding pseudocritical couplings within L ∈ [64, 2048]. These values agree with several other MC estimates at the assumption of the power-law corrections and are comparable with the known results of the epsilon-expansion. In addition, we have tested the consistency with the scaling corrections of the form  ∝ L−4/3,  and , which might be expected from some considerations of the renormalization group and Coulomb gas model. The latter option is consistent with our MC data. Our MC results served as a basis for a critical reconsideration of some earlier theoretical conjectures and scaling assumptions. In particular, we have corrected and refined our previous analysis by grouping Feynman diagrams. The renewed analysis gives ω ≈ 4 − d − 2η as some approximation for spatial dimensions d < 4, or ω ≈ 1.5 in two dimensions.",

Specifically, the social human behavior consists of many physiological and psychological processes which are still largely unknown. To model reliably such human crowd systems with complex social interactions, stochastic tools play an important role for the setting of mathematical formulations of the problems. In this work, using the description based on an exclusion principle, we study a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model for active-passive population dynamics with an application to human crowd behaviors. We provide representative numerical examples for the evacuation dynamics of human crowds, where the main focus in our considerations is given to an interacting particle system of active and passive human groups. Furthermore, our numerical results show that the communication between active and passive humans strongly influences the evacuation time of the whole population even when a local “faster-is-slower” phenomenon is taken into account. To provide an additional inside into the problem, a stationary state of our model is analyzed via current representations and heat map techniques.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder nowadays. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins are among the main contributors to the AD progression. In AD, Aβ proteins clump together to form plaques and disrupt cell functions. On the other hand, the abnormal chemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the neuron’s transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in the brain by clearing the Aβ plaques (toxic Aβ). However, overactivated astrocytes release chemokines and cytokines in the presence of Aβ and react to pro-inflammatory cytokines, further increasing the production of Aβ. In this study, we construct a mathematical model that can capture astrocytes’ dual behavior. Furthermore, we reveal that the disease progression depends on the current time instance and the disease’s earlier status, called the “memory effect,” making non-Markovian processes an appropriate approach. We consider a fractional order network mathematical model to capture the influence of such memory effects on AD progression. We have integrated brain connectome data into the model and studied the memory effect, the dual role of astrocytes, and the brain’s neuronal damage. Based on the pathology, primary, secondary, and mixed tauopathies parameters are considered in the model. Due to the mixed tauopathy, different brain nodes or regions in the brain connectome accumulate different toxic concentrations of Aβ and tau proteins. Finally, we explain how the memory effect can slow down the propagation of such toxic proteins in the brain, decreasing the rate of neuronal damage.",

    "abstract": "In bio-social models, cooperative behaviour has evolved as an adaptive strategy, playing multi-functional roles. One of such roles in populations is to increase the success of survival and reproduction of individuals and their families or social groups. Moreover, collective decision-making in cooperative behaviour is an aspect that is used to study the dynamic behaviour of individuals within a social group. In this paper, we have focused on population dynamics by considering a predator-prey model as our main exemplification, where the generalist predator has adopted a cooperative hunting strategy while consuming their prey. In particular, we have analyzed the dynamic nature of the system when a nonlocal term is introduced in the cooperation. First, the Turing instability condition has been studied for the local model around the coexisting steady-state, followed by the Turing and non-Turing patterns in the presence of the nonlocal interaction term. This work is also concerned with the existence of travelling wave solutions for predator-prey interaction with the nonlocal cooperative hunting strategy. Such solutions are reported for local as well as for nonlocal models. We have characterized the invading speed of the predator with the help of the minimal wave speed of travelling wave solutions connecting the predator-free state to the co-existence state. The travelling waves are found to be non-monotonic in this system. The formation of wave trains has been demonstrated for an extended range of nonlocal interactions. Finally, the importance of psychological effects in shaping the dynamics of nonlocal collective behaviour is demonstrated with several representative examples.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of predator–prey systems in the presence of different environmental variability is crucial in ecology for forecasting population behaviour and ensuring ecosystem sustainability. It is a challenging aspect of studying spatio-temporal dynamics in the presence of environmental variability. We provide a noise-induced spatio-temporal predator–prey model to explore how temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity affect population dynamics. The multiplicative stochastic fluctuations in space and time are considered in the prey’s growth rate and predator’s death rate to capture the demographic noise in the ecosystem. We first examine the deterministic models by finding crucial parameters that influence the stability and dynamics of predator and prey populations, following their impact on spatio-temporal pattern formation. Using analytical tools and numerical simulations, we illuminate the mechanisms behind the observed dynamics and highlight the significance of demographic noise in generating ecological patterns. The numerical simulations show that the temporal variability introduced by noise leads to oscillations in population densities and alters the stability of the predator–prey system. Special attention is given to the spatio-temporal system when it fails to produce Turing patterns without noise, and the results show that linear demographic change can cause complex behaviours, such as self-organization, irregular oscillations, and nonequilibrium dynamics. Nevertheless, these findings broadly affect various ecological phenomena, including population persistence, species coexistence, long transients, and ecosystem resilience to demographic perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) belongs to the class of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the central nervous system. It is usually defined as the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which causes both motor and non-motor symptoms. Understanding the neuronal processes that underlie PD is critical for creating successful therapies. This study combines machine learning (ML), stochastic modelling, and Bayesian inference with connectomic data to analyse the brain networks involved in PD. We use modern computational methods to study large-scale neural networks to identify neuronal activity patterns related to PD development. We aim to define the subtle structural and functional connection changes in PD brains by combining connectomic with stochastic noises. Stochastic modelling approaches reflect brain dynamics’ intrinsic variability and unpredictability, shedding light on the origin and spread of pathogenic events in PD. We employ a novel hybrid model to assess how stochastic noise impacts the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CBGTH) network, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Bayesian inference allows us to quantify uncertainty in model parameters, improving the accuracy of our predictions. Our findings reveal that stochastic disturbances increase thalamus activity, even under deep brain stimulation (DBS). Bayesian analysis suggests that reducing these disturbances could enhance healthy brain states, providing insights for potential therapeutic interventions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of PD dynamics and paves the way for personalized treatment strategies.

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A⁢𝛽) peptides and calcium ions (Ca2+) serve critical roles in various physiological processes inside neurons, but their dysregulation is involved in the development of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Particularly, A⁢𝛽42 peptides alter Ca2+ homeostasis, resulting in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage. On the other hand, Ca2+ ions can affect A⁢𝛽 aggregation and clearance routes, either worsening or improving AD pathogenesis. We have considered a deterministic model for A⁢𝛽−Ca2+ interaction and studied its noise-induced dynamics. The stochastic sensitivity analysis helps to find the confidential ellipses for the stable attractors of the stochastic system. In addition, we have developed a network model based on the interaction between A⁢𝛽 peptides and Ca2+ ions to comprehend their dynamics in the brain connectome better. The probabilistic evolution approach characterizes the dynamics of the stochastic network model and estimates the potentials required to escape from one attractor to another. The numerical simulations suggest that the more connected node requires more energy to switch its state, and the noise intensity plays a crucial role in such cases. Furthermore, this study reveals that external perturbations on A⁢𝛽−Ca2+ dynamics uncover novel targets for drug development and provide insights into the complex interplay between protein misfolding and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease pathology.",

We investigate how the brain’s biological processes and associated multiphysics interact and how this influences the structure and functionality of the brain. We review the literature on brain network models and dynamic processes, highlighting the need for sophisticated mathematical and statistical modelling techniques. Specifically, we go through large-scale brain network models relevant to AD and PD, highlighting the pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies investigated in the literature. Additionally, we investigate the propagation of CSD in the brain and its implications for neurological disorders. Furthermore, we discuss how data-driven approaches and artificial neural networks refine and validate models related to NDDs. Overall, this review underscores the significance of coupled multiscale models in deciphering disease mechanisms, offering potential avenues for therapeutic development and advancing our understanding of pathological brain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling is one of the fundamental techniques for understanding biophysical mechanisms in developmental biology. It helps researchers to analyze complex physiological processes and connect like a bridge between theoretical and experimental observations. Various groups of mathematical models have been studied to analyze these processes, and the nonlocal models are one of them. Nonlocality is important in realistic mathematical models of physical and biological systems when local models fail to capture the essential dynamics and interactions that occur over a range of distances (e.g., cell-cell, cell–tissue adhesions, neural networks, the spread of diseases, intra-specific competition, nanobeams, etc.). This review illustrates different nonlocal mathematical models applied to biology and life sciences. The major focus has been given to sources, developments, and applications of such models. Among other things, a systematic discussion has been provided for the conditions of pattern formations in biological systems of population dynamics. Special attention has also been given to nonlocal interactions on networks, network coupling and integration, including brain dynamics models that provide an important tool to understand neurodegenerative diseases better. In addition, we have discussed nonlocal modeling approaches for cancer stem cells and tumor cells that are widely applied in the cell migration processes, growth, and avascular tumors in any organ. Furthermore, the discussed nonlocal continuum models can go sufficiently smaller scales, including nanotechnology, where classical local models often fail to capture the complexities of nanoscale interactions, applied to build biosensors to sense biomaterial and its concentration. Piezoelectric and other smart materials are among them, and these devices are becoming increasingly important in the digital and physical world that is intrinsically interconnected with biological systems. Additionally, we have reviewed a nonlocal theory of peridynamics, which deals with continuous and discrete media and applies to model the relationship between fracture and healing in cortical bone, tissue growth and shrinkage, and other areas increasingly important in biomedical and bioengineering applications. Finally, we provided a comprehensive summary of emerging trends and highlighted future directions in this rapidly expanding field. ",

The theory in the framework of the asymptotic matching is mainly supported by (1) the length scale √𝜆𝐷𝐿𝑐 that suitably characterizes the structure of the double layer in ionic liquids, with 𝜆𝐷 referring to the Debye length and 𝐿𝑐 referring to the electrostatic correlation length, and (2) the charging time, 𝜏𝑐=𝜆3/2 𝐷𝐿/(𝐷𝐿1/2 𝑐), where 𝐷 is the diffusion coefficient and 𝐿 is the thickness of the electrolyte. With this response time, the diffuse-charge dynamics is deduced at the leading order to obtain an analytic expression for low-frequency impedance. As a result of the new length scaling √𝜆𝐷𝐿𝑐, we additionally study the behavior of double-layer in graphene-metal electrochemical systems involving ionic liquids, where electrostatic correlation length 𝐿𝑐 is found to play a prominent role in the linear regime.
