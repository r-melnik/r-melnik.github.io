Man-made systems include engineering systems, as well as context-dependent complex dynamic structures. Among others, examples of such structures may include social and financial systems and their networks. By developing tools and methods of mathematical modeling and by applying them along with two other research methodologies based on theory and experiment, we seek a better understanding of new phenomena and processes in studying complex dynamic systems which include coupled human-environment systems, as well as man-made systems. In most cases, our focus is on coupled multiscale phenomena and processes in such systems. <a href='/research'>Read More About Our Research</a><br/><a href='/research' class='px-5 d-flex justify-center'> <img src='/research-logo.png' class='w-100 max-w-700' /> </a>"

At the <strong>M3AI<sup>®</sup> Lab, </strong> we focus on the development of coupled mathematical models for addressing fundamental questions of science and solving new problems in science and engineering. Our main interests lie with <strong>Complex Dynamic Systems,</strong> typically capable of information processing.

Since systems and phenomena we study usually involve interactions of processes over a range of spatial and temporal scales, such problems are often multiscale in their nature. Many such problems are coupled problems and in the context of physical and engineering applications are often termed as multi-physics. The term 'coupled', however, is more generic as it is applied also to problems in bilogy, medicine, and other fields in science & engineering. Some of the models we deal with are non-local and therefore can be represented by integro-differential equations (e.g., problems involving collisions of many particles or interactions of many bodies provide typical examples), while others are essentially discrete models. Our interests include also non-equilibrium processes and systems far from their equilibrium. In a number of situations we have to take into account incompleteness of the information about the system or phenomenon we study which lead to stochastic models and probabilistic approaches. The models we deal with covers the spatial scales from nano to macro levels as well as a range of time scales."

Mathematical models provide a ubiquitous framework for scientific progress, the development of new technologies, sustainable development of society, and the ever-expanding boundaries of human knowledge. They also serve as a natural safeguard against narrow specialization which, according to Einstein, is damaging to scientific progress and the true spirit of research."

Understanding coupled processes has important implications for applications in such fields as medicine and biotechnology and many others as well. The problems that arise are intrinsically interdisciplinary and their solutions require the development of advanced mathematical tools. Such problems are rapidly becoming pervasive in our increasingly interconnected, multiscale dynamic world. They appear at different spatial scales, from the nanoscale to the global scale. Coupled systems, processes and phenomena are ubiquitous in physical and biological worlds, in engineering, environmental, and social sciences, business, finance, and economics.

I taught around 60 different courses at the university level. They range from Data Analysis, Statistical Methods, and Stochastic Processes to Mathematical Modelling for Science and Finance Applications. I taught courses at all levels, from freshman to Ph.D., and some of them I taught to the students from different disciplines, including the students from engineering departments, as well as from sciences such as biology and psychology. Some additional information about my Teaching Portfolio can be found <a href='/links/teaching'>here</a>. No doubt that I have learned a lot from my students, not only because 'to teach is to learn twice', but because each student brings to the class his or her own inspiration and energy, helping me to appreciate better words of Henry Ford who once said: 'Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty; anyone who keeps learning stays young.' I do hope also that my students have learned a lot from me and what I do in the class is striving to pass a long-lasting interest to the subjects I teach to my students and demonstrating that 'the mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be ignited'. In this way, I put myself into a position to claim what once was claimed by Henry Adams: 'A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops'."

As such, the AHI is subject to human errors. During their evolution, humans have been using both organic and inorganic worlds to serve them better. In this sense, the idea of “artificial intelligence” is no different. A well-known example where the word “intelligence” has been built-in in the definition of the modern concepts includes “intelligent materials” due to their intrinsic properties of innate nature to adapt and/or react to external stimuli. Moreover, developing this concept further, some materials are attributed properties of “smartness” when they “learn” how to adapt and/or change in response to external stimuli. From “hardware”, the concepts of “intelligence” and “smartness” have been moved to “software”. What is lacking in this picture is one fundamental detail.

Most such problems require mathematical modeling approaches for their solution. As many areas of science and engineering were conventionally divided in the past, these problems were difficult to address. With the development of new mathematical modeling techniques, such as those based on multifield, multiscale approaches, the situation is rapidly changing and we are now in a position to meet such challenges. Therefore, during 5 years of this project, which was run based on Ingenta technology, the editorial team handled contributions in all aspects of this development directed toward the study of coupled dynamic systems, phenomena, and processes, both deterministic and stochastic. This included model developments for coupled dynamic problems, their applications, fundamental mathematical problems in advancing the theory of coupled dynamic systems, as well as the development of new numerical procedures, high performance computing, and algorithmic aspects related to solving such problems."

They cover topics and methods in fields of current interest that use mathematical approaches to understand and explain, model and influence phenomena in all areas of life sciences. This includes, among others, theory and application of biological mathematical modeling, complex systems biology, bioinformatics, computational biomodeling stochastic modeling, biostatistics, computational evolutionary biology, comparative genomics, or structural bioinformatics. The series also covers new types of mathematical problems that arise from biological knowledge. With contributions on the borderline of mathematics and life sciences, stimulating further research at the crossroads of these areas, the main objectives of the series has been to make such expositions available to and accessible by an interdisciplinary, growing readership hailing from all disciplines involved."

Members of the centre together with their colleagues from other disciplines run several highly successful seminar series. They were active in establishing and maintaining links with colleagues from other institutions, inside and outside of Canada, as well as with industrial companies. At the CDCS Centre, both analytical and numerical methods were developed for solving challenging problems that appear at the cutting edge of scientific and technological applications. Over a decade, the CDCS researchers sponsored many undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and visitors. These traditions have been continued by the <a href='https://researchcentres.wlu.ca/ms2discovery-interdisciplinary-research-institute/' target='_blank' >MS2Discovery Interdisciplinary Research Institute</a >."

Many such problems require dealing with processes and phenomena that have components interacting in a complicated manner; they are &quot;coupled&quot;. Better understanding such processes and phenomena has important implications for applications in such diverse fields as optoelectronics, medicine, biotechnology, and finance, environmental and energy-saving technologies, among many others."

The series was founded by   Prof. Ilias Kotsireas  and Prof. Roderick Melnik who were this series’ main organizers and coordinators. The seminar series, that was run from 2004 till 2014, became an important networking activity in Ontario in the field of computational science and modelling. In 2014 the activities carried out by the Centre for Coupled Dynamics & Complex Systems and CSASM were passed to the newly created MS2Discovery Interdisciplinary Research Institute."
