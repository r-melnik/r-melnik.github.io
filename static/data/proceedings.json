    "abstract": "In this paper we treat mathematical and computational models of thermodynamical systems in complex media as optimal information control problems. Under assumptions of sufficient smoothness on the perturbed Hamiltonian of the system, we propose reformulations of the classical problems using the concept of informational limit. In the general situation, we use Steklov's operator technique to derive generalizations of classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in stochastic, non-smooth, and deterministic cases. We show that a non-conservation law equation appears naturally from such a consideration. For its approximation we use an evolution-associated Markov chain which permits us to derive stability conditions for our computational models. The computational models of this type give a description of generalized dynamical systems (GDS) which include the modeler (decision maker, DM) as an intrinsic part. Several application examples are discussed in the context of multilayered structures such as superlattices where we have to deal with mathematical models with discontinuous characteristics.",

Even if the spatial operator is spectrally discretised, the solution of nonstationary problems requires a temporal discretisation that dictates a typically severe restriction on the method applicability in convection-dominated regions. To resolve these difficulties we develop a new method based on a combination of the Cayley transform technique and an effective iterated mapping.

    "abstract": "In this paper we analyze propblems of mathematical modeling in microelectronics on the basis of a hierarchy constrated with respect to the relaxation time functions. For the analysis of non-equilibrium and non-local processes in semiconductors, effective numerical procedures based on non-conservative monotone schemeshave been developed, algorithmic realization of the proposed schemes have been proposed, and results of computational experiments on device modeling have been presented. From a mathematical point of view, the models considered in this paper provide an important practical example of stiff systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) with source terms. The availabilityof the conservative property for such systems depends on the definition of the source terms which are always a subject of approximations. If perturbation techniques are applied to such problems, the natural space for perturbations become L1 rather than L2. A challenging problem arises from the fact that the flow map representing the solution of such systems is typically not differentiable with respect to the linaer structure of L1. This leads to majoe difficulties in the analysis of the systems that are described by stiff PDEs, because the contractivity property of the flow for such systems with respect to L1-distance is no longer true in general. As a result, reasonable alternatives to classical and continuous mathematical models for semiconductor device modeling become discrete physics-based topological models, semi-classical, and quantum models. In the development of such models, the role of effective computational techniques essentially increases.",

    "abstract": "Non-smooth dynamic systems appear routinely in many applications of control and game theory. By constructing mathematical models in these fields we often have to deal with evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs), solution of which are not smooth enough to satisfy these equations in the classical sense. A classical example is provided by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations that approximately describe dynamics of value/cost functions which may not be differentiable everywhere. These equations can be formally derived by applying Bellman's dynamic programming approach in a heuristic manner, and much research in control theory has been devoted to the clarification of the connection between this approach and the Pontryagin maximum principle in the non-smooth and stochastic cases. This paper is devoted to the analysis of this connection under relaxed smoothness requirements in non-reflexive Banach spaces and to the approximation of HJB equations in these spaces.The author proposes a unified treatment of non-smooth and stochastic control problems using mathematical models of HJB-type obtained with Steklov's operator technique. Until recently, the analysis of such models has been predominantly conducted in reflexive Banach spaces. The situation has changes since the introduction of the L1 control theory. Due to new and emerging applications of control systems in engineering, non-reflexive Banach spaces become the most reasonable functional classes for perturbations in such problems where control systems have to work in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This paper contributes to the construction and the analysis of approximate PDE models for the description of control systems in such situations. ",

    "type": "Proceeding",
    "abstract": "In many industrial applications we have to deal with materials that exhibit typically nonlinear thermomechanical behaviour. Rubber-like polymers. Rubber-like polymers are one of the most cited examples of such materials. It is not a surprising fact, inasmuch as desirable thermomechanical properties of rubber-like polymers at an economical cost made these materials relatively cheap alternative to more traditional metallic materials in many consumer products, as well as in automotive and aircraft industries. The existing applications of polymers and the design of polymers with improved thermomechanical characteristics require the development of adequate mathematical tools to describethe coupled thermomechanical dynamics of these materials. Although rubber-like polymers provide a classical example where nonlinear effects are essential in the adequate description of material dynamics, only a few recent papers have discussed numerical results obtained for these materialswith general nonlinear models of coupled thermoelasticity. In dealing with the nonlinear behaviour of such materials we must give a proper weight to the fact that nonlinearities in the dynamics of rubber-like materials are closely interwoven with the effect of thermal relaxation time. Mathematical models of hyperbolic thermoelasticity, known as models with relaxation times, are based on hyperbolic-type equations for temperature. Such models deserve more attention than has been accorded in the past. Despite an increasing attention that has been given in recent years to the numerical analysis of nonlinear effects in classical thermoelasticity, the results on the influence of the combined effects of nonlinearity and the thermal relaxation on thermomechanical properties of materials are virtually absent in the literature. However, in many cases these effects become key factors in the adequate description of the dynamical behaviour of thermoelastic systems. In particular, it is well-known that nonlinear terms in the equation of motion and the energy balance equation may lead to the formation of discontinuous profiles of displacement and temperature (shock profiles). In the regions of such discontinuities the combined effects of nonlinearity and the thermal relaxation become significant. From a practical point of view, these effects are especially important in such areas as manufacturing of electronic components and process engineering to name just a few.In this paper we deal with rubber-like solid polymers that, in contrast to many other solid materials such as metals or ceramics, are energy elastic, and since they have relatively large thermal relaxation times, they demonstrate hyperbolic effects in a more pronounced fashion compared to \"hard\" solids. We study numerically a combined effect of hyperbolicity and nonlinearity on the dynamics of such materials. Modelling the thermomechanical behaviour of a ring-shaped body with the Lord-Shulman-type model, we demonstrate an intrinsic connection between nonlinear effects and hyperbolicity of the dynamics. In particular, we show that the vanishing relaxation time can lead to the superposition of nonlinearities. ",

    "abstract": "Polymeric materials and polymer-based composites became an intrinsic part of many new industrial materials technologies where structural engineering and material engineering research go hand in hand. This research relies heavily on the fact that the material from which the end-use structure is made can be \"designed\" in principle and adapted to suit specific engineering purposes. A core component in this research, both from the technological and theoretical point of view, is to be able to extract the information about the macroscopic (thermomechanical, structural) properties of polymers from their microscopic (atomistic) constitution.Since microscopic, atomistically detailed models of materials provide a key to a better understanding of their behaviour at the macroscopic level, the development of such models and algorithms for their implementation become an important activity in industrial materials research, in particular in polymer and composite sciences. The computer-aided molecular design of structures using effective algorithms leads to the situation where compounds and composites worthy of actual synthesis can be effectively identified.In solving molecular conformation problems, stochastic methods based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have become quite popular among the researchers. However, the computer time required for full conformational search by the MD and MC algorithms and many other stochastic search methods (genetic algorithms, e.g.) is often hardly feasible for real polymeric systemsand composites. The situation is not better for the majority of deterministic methods that, due to their exhaustive search of the conformational space, are becoming less feasible computationally when designing complex new material structures. Despite recent progress, all these methods are still computationally very demanding and, most importantly, the success of their applications to realistic polymer systems relies heavily on the choice of initial conformation. Therefore, a real challengefor these types of algorithms is to build plausible initial configurations which can then be relaxed effectively. Although for complex polymeric systems and composites this has often proved to be a difficult task, it has to be tackled in order to provide the real opportunity to design, characterize and optimize these materials before undertaking expensive experimental work. In this contribution we argue that moving towards atomistic simulations of complex polymer systems and composites, another group of stochastic search methods, known under its generic name as distance geometry (DG), will play an increasingly important role. Formulating the general distance geometry problem in atomistic simulation of materials as an optimization problem, we apply two distance geometry algorithms to its solution and analyze their performance for bulk decane molecules. The comparative analysis of the described algorithms in applications to cross-linked polymeric structures is a natural extension of the presented work. ",

    "abstract": "An increasing interest in smart material and structure technology generated by many industrial applications has put a special emphasis on a better understanding of the dynamical behaviour of piezoelectrics as an integral part of this technology. In some such applications piezoelectric sensors and actuators are used as embedded control elements in advanced composites and smart structures that are subjected to severe mechanical and thermal environments. The influence of thermal effects on the dynamic behaviour of piezoelectrics and the coupling between thermal, mechanical, and electric fields are key issues int he analysis of such structures.In this paper the influence of coupled thermal and electric fields on mechanical characteristics of piezoceramic-based devices has been analyzed numerically. On the example of axysymmetric oscillations of hollow thin-walled piezoceramic cylinders it is shown that the thermal field can contribute substantially to such important characteristics of devices as radial displacements. The observed effects become increasingly important in such cases where a piezoelectric has to be considered as a part of a smart structure whose response piezoelectric sensors should monitor, or where the piezoelectric-based device is imbedded into an acoustic interacting media. Although technically non-trivial, mathematically it is relatively straightforward to generalize our numerical schemes to these cases. ",

    "abstract": "Since the phase change in SMA-based devices such as actuators is accompanied by a significant heat exchange with the surroundings, different concepts to heat/cool SMAs have been proposed in the literature. Most of these concepts require the analysis of a multilayered (e.g., \"sandwich\"-type) structure where the SMA layer is placed between layers with another material. In this paper we propose a mathematical model and an efficient numerical method for this analysis. Although our approach can be applied to a wide range of different designs of multilayered actuators, the basic idea of the model construction is explained in this paper for a specific design based on the introduction of semiconductor \"heat pump\" modules into the device and the Peltier effect for the heat exchange. The dynamics of thermomechanical fields is studied with a coupled system of PDEs based on conservation laws. The system, supplemented by constitutive relationships in the Falk form, is reduced to a differential-algebraic (DA) model and solved with an effective DA solver developed in our previous works. Numerical results on thermomechanical behaviour of SMA components in multilayered actuators are presented.",

    "type": "Proceeding",
    "abstract": "Time-dependent convection-diffusion models appear frequently in many branches of computational mechanics including, but not limited to, fluid dynamics and electro-magnetic theory. They also serve as building blocks for many complex applied problems requiring coupling several different physical fields. The development of efficient discretisation methodologies for such models represents a challenging and important area of research in computational mechanics. Earlier we proposed an efficient methodology for the full time-space discretisation convection-diffusion-absorption equations based on the Cayley transform technique. Recently a general framework based on the so-called strongly P-positive operator technique has been developed. Due to its ability to generate exponentially convergent algorithms easily amenable to efficient parallelisation strategies, this framework allows one to construct such algorithms for full time-space discretisations of evolutionary differential equations that have several important advantages over conventional algorithms (including those with polynomial convergence). In this paper we use this general framework to develop further our ideas in the context of time-dependent convection-diffusion problems. In particular, we construct exponentially convergent discretisations for these problems by using an efficient representation of the operator exponent and appropriate quadratures based on the Sinc approximations of corresponding integrals. We note that in this case the resulting quadratures, consisting of a sum of operator resolvents, can be effectively (at almost linear cost) approximated by the H-matrix technique. The situation where the diffusion coefficient is small due to the presence of boundary layers is also discussed. The algorithms presented in this paper admit parallel implementations in terms of both the computation of resolvents and the time stepping. ",

It is shown that the quantum-dot ground state of the combined structure is considerably affected by the presence of the wetting layer, and similarly, wetting-layer states are affected by the presence of the quantum dot. This quantum dot/wetting layer state interference is expected to have an impact on carrier-capture phenomena and operation speeds of electronic and optical devices using quantum dots as active regions.",

This dynamic coupling is an intrinsic feature of many systems, processes, and phenomena with numerous examples in mechatronics, geophysics, biomechanics, and many other fields. In some cases the interacting components of the system could be structures, fluid, or solid media, as, e.g., in geophysical applications, while in other cases the interacting components could be given in the form of fields such as mechanical and thermal, or electrical and mechanical, invoking a unification of two or more physical theories that have been considered separately before, e.g. thermoelasticity, electroelasticity, hydroelasticity, etc.A common feature of all these problems is that in most practically interesting cases the resulting mathematical models are not amenable to the analytical treatment, and the development of efficient numerical procedures for their solutions is required. In this paper I am interested in efficient scientific computing tools allowing us to adequately describe the complex nonlinear behaviour of materials with memory, in particular shape memory alloys. My main tool will be the centre manifold technique linked together with effective computational procedures for the model construction.",

In this paper we develop a new dynamic model of 3D SMA which employs an improved version of the microscopic Landau theory. Essential properties of the single and multivariant martensitic phase transformations are recovered using consistent steps, which eliminates the problem of non-uniqueness of energy partitioning and relaxes the over-sensitivity of the free energy due to many unknown material constants in previously reported models.

In this paper, we develop a new Landau-Ginzburg free energy model for such a problem and demonstrate its link with the continuum description of phase transformations. This leads us to a possiblity of using the precise description of compatible microstructures in the phase-field model that allows us to improve computational effectiveness of the finite element model.

    "abstract": "Dynamics of Phase Transformation (PT) in Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) under the combined effect of stress and temperature is one of the most complex and intriguing phenomena, which is far from completely tractable till date. Propagation of the transformation fronts as they are spontaneously formed and diffused under constraints in the macroscopic structure is one of the important aspects that influence the performance of SMAs as sensors and actuators. The initial state, the transients and the characteristics of stress and the thermal cycles play important roles in the device performance. Investigation of these aspects using crystallographic framework of the constituent materials, and subsequently, tackling the complexities in carrying out numerical simulation in the physical scales constitutes the main theme of this paper. Three-dimensional Gibbs free-energy is derived by consistent partitioning the chemical energy and the transformation energy. In order to perform the time-resolved analysis of real SMA device having truly three-dimensional geometry, a 3D nonlinear finite element model is developed and a large-scale computational scheme is proposed. The variational framework couples (1) the momentum balance (2) the heat\nconduction and (3) the first-order phase kinetics.

A model of the evolution of CNT thin film is proposed, where the CNTs are assumed to decay by fragmentation and formation of plasma consisting of carbon atoms and impurities. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electrodynamic interaction among themselves are modeled to explain the self-assembly caused by dynamic reorientation of the CNTs. Finally, the nucleation coupled degradation model and the electrodynamic forcing model are employed to estimate the current-voltage characteristics based on the modified Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission.

    "abstract": "Mechanical vibrations constitute a common phenomenon in applications of many engineering structures and systems. Such vibrations should often be tuned according to a specific application. In many application developments, a supplementary oscillator with a suitable frequency is attached to the primary system, by which the primary vibration can be tuned. For the cases where the primary vibration frequency is uncertain, it is always beneficial to make a supplementary vibration frequency continuously variable in a rather wide range. In other cases, when the excitation might not be a mono-frequency or harmonic, or the frequency drifts, the vibration absorber is expected to be robust and still be able to tune the vibration at some extent. In the present paper, we model the performance of a shape memory alloy oscillator used as a vibration absorber. It consists of a shape memory alloy rod and an end-mass. The vibration characteristic of the oscillator is continuously adjustable by changing its temperature, due to the thermo-mechanical coupling property of the shape memory alloy rod. In addition, the first order phase transformation in the SMA rod at low temperatures also contributes robustly to vibration attenuation, due to hysteresis induced. This is can be used for the cases where the vibration and excitation frequencies are unknown, or drift. The dynamic response of the SMA oscillator is modeled by a nonlinear partial differential equation using the modified Ginzburg-Landau theory. This model is then simplified to a nonlinear model convenient for the vibration analysis. Since the SMA oscillator has a very strong nonlinearity, its frequency response is not obtainable in analytical form. We use numerical simulation tools to evaluate its performance. It is demonstrated that the SMA oscillator is able to tune the vibration of the primary system within a rather wide frequency range. The performance of the SMA oscillator is close to a regular linear oscillator at high temperature when only the austenite phase exists. The vibration attenuation of the SMA oscillator at low temperature exhibits a more complicated behaviour induced by the hysteresis effects in the SMA rod.",

    "abstract": "Due to their unique thermo-mechanical properties, the range of existing and potential applications of shape memory alloys (SMA) continues to grow. Many of these applications take advantage of the dynamic response of SMA under dynamic loading conditions. From the engineering design point of view, this requires a better understanding of the effect of phase transformations and thermo-mechanical coupling on wave propagation in the material. In achieving this goal, a fundamental task is to analyse the dynamics of first order phase transformations induced by shock loadings.\n\nIn this contribution, a mathematical model and its numerical discretization are constructed to analyse the wave propagation in shape memory alloy rods. The first order martensitic transformations and the associated effects of thermo-mechanical coupling are accounted for by employing the modified Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire. The Landau-type free energy function characterizes different phases, while a Ginzburg term is introduced to account for the internal friction during phase transformations. The effect of the Ginzburg term on wave propagation patterns is analysed under shock loadings implemented via stress boundary conditions. For practical numerical simulations of SMA samples, the constructed model of coupled nonlinear system of PDEs is reduced to a system of differential-algebraic equations, where the Chebyshev collocation method is employed for the spatial discretization, while the backward differentiation is used for the integration in time.\n\nA series of numerical experiments is carried out on copper-based SMA samples. Propagation of stress waves induced by shock loadings is analysed for different initial temperature. It is demonstrated that the patterns of wave propagation is complicated at low temperatures by phase transformations, while more regular patterns are observed for high temperature distributions. These observations are in agreement with experiments. Finally, the influence of viscosity effects on the overall thermo-mechanical behaviour of rods is analysed numerically by evaluating the contribution of the Ginzburg term responsible for the internal friction during phase transformations.",

We focus our attention on the cases of steady shear and extensional flows of polymeric solutions. First, the tensors with moments other than the second order moment are approximated. Then, the nonlinear algebraic equation for the second moment conformation tensor is solved. Finally, substituting the resulting conformation tensor into the Kramers equation of Hookean spring force, the constitutive equations for the model are obtained. The shear material properties are discussed in the context of different internal viscosities and our computational results are compared with the results of other methods applicable for high shear or extensional rates.

In this work, a modeling approach has been devloped, which handles several complexities at the device scale. From device design point of view, this work sheds light on the coupling issues related to the mechanics, the thermodynamics, and the process of collective field emission from CNTs in a thin film. All the mathematical treatments are combined and solved to calculate the output current using Fowler-Nordheim (FN) equation.

    "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown in a thin film have shown great potential as cathodes for the development several field emission devices. However, in modeling these important devices we face substantial challenges since the CNTs in a thin film undergo complex dynamics during field emission, which includes processes such as (1) evolution, (2) electromechanical interaction, (3) thermoelectric heating and (4) ballistic transport. These processes are coupled, nonlinear, and multiphysics in their nature. Therefore, they must be analyzed accurately from the stability and long-term performance view-point of the device. Fairly detailed physics-based models of CNTs considering some of these aspects have recently been reported by us. In this paper, we extend these models and focus on their computational implementation. All components of models are integrated at the computational level in a systematic manner in order to accurately calculate main characteristics such as the device current, which are particularly important for stable performance of CNT thin film cathodes in x-ray devices for precision biomedical instrumentation. The numerical simulations reported in this paper are able to reproduce several experimentally observed phenomena, which include fluctuating field emission current, deflected CNT tips and the heating process.",

    "volume": "1",
    "type": "Proceeding",
    "abstract": "Field emission (FE) from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on a cathode substrate is difficult to characterize using simple formulae or data fitting, which is due to (1) electron-phonon interaction (2) electromechanical force field leading to stretching of CNTs (3) ballistic transport induced thermal spikes, coupled with high dynamic stress, leading to degradation of emission performance at the device scale. Fairly detailed physics-based models of CNTs considering the aspects (1) and (2) above have already been developed by these authors. However, design optimization issues aimed at better FE devices to reduce the extent of electro-mechanical fatigues and improved spatio-temporal localization of emitted electrons remain open and important areas of research. With due success in designing such devices, various applications such as in-situ biomedical x-rays probes and thin film pixel based imaging technology etc., to name just a few, are of great significance. In this paper we analyze a new design concept, wherein (a) the electrodynamic force field leading to strong electron-phonon interaction during ballistic transport and also (b) the usually observed reorientation of the CNT tips and instability due to coulomb repulsions, can be harnessed optimally. In the proposed design, we introduce two additional gates on the edges of the cathode substrate. An array of stacked CNTs is considered on the cathode substrate. The height of the CNTs is such that a symmetric force field is maintained in each pixel with respect to the central axis parallel to vertical axis . As a result, it is expected that a maximum current density as well as well-shaped beam can be produced under DC voltage across the cathode-anode structure. In the present design, the anode is assumed to be simply a uniform conducting slab. However, such an anode can be replaced with a porous thin film along with MEMS-based beam control mechanism. The present design objective is to estimate the field emission current as function of the side-wise gate height dc with respect to the CNT height h and the slope of stacking of the CNT tips. Results show the transverse electric field distribution in the pixel, which directly influences the field emission current. Details of a coupled model involving ballistic transport of electrons, electron-phonon interaction and nonlinear deformation of the CNTs due to electrodynamics forces will be discussed, followed by optimization studies involving the parameters dc/h and Vg/VDC, where Vg denotes the side-wise gate voltage and VDC denotes the DC voltage across the anode-cathode structure.",

    "abstract": "It has been found experimentally that the results related to the collective field emission performance of carbonnanotube (CNT) arrays show variability. The emission performance depends on the electronic structure of CNTs (especially their tips). Due to limitations in the synthesis process, production of highly pure and defect free CNTs is very difficult. The presence of defects and impurities affects the electronic structure of CNTs. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the effect ofdefects on the electronic structure, and hence, the field emission current. In this paper, we develop a modeling approach for evaluating the effect of defects and impurities on the overall field emission performance of a CNT array. We employ a concept of effective stiffness degradation for segments of CNTs, which is due to structural defects. Then, we incorporate the vacancy defects and charge impurity effects in our Green's function based approach. Simulation results indicate decrease in average current due to the presence of such defects and impurities.",

    "abstract": "In this work we analyze numerically the contributions of nonlinear electromechanical effects in nano-heterostructures, focusing on the effect of electrostriction. The main novelty of the present paper lies with the fact that the latter effect has not been analyzed in nano-heterostructures before with multidimensional models.\nWe start our analysis with a continuum three-dimensional axisymmetric model, accounting for complete selfconsistency of electromechanical fields. Although the techniques developed here, can be applied to other material heterostructures, all our examples in this paper are given for GaN/AlN nano-heterostructures. One of the reasons for that is an increasing range of current and potential applications of these nanostructures in optoelectronic devices. We consider in our examples a cylindrical GaN/AlN nano-heterostructure which allows us to reduce the original problem to a two-dimensional model. This reduction goes with a remark that albeit the wurtzite symmetry is not axisymmetric, Navier's equations do reflect axisymmetry [1].\n\nWe note also that recently the analysis of such nanostructures have been carried out in [2]. The analysis was selfconsistent in lattice mismatches, spontaneous polarization, piezoelectric effect, and strain and has been performed by employing a linear (static and dynamic) and nonlinear (static with electrostriction) electromechanical model framework developed there. However, it was restricted to the one-dimensional situation.\n\nIn spite of the belief that a combination of dimensional effects and electrostriction could lead to interesting new physics, the problem was lacking attention partly due to a sparse experimental information on electrostrictive tensor components in the nitrides. Here, due to the availability of experimental information on the electrostriction coefficient connecting the electric field along the z-direction with the strain component, our attention was drawn to only this component of electrostriction.\n\nIn order to deal with the inherent discontinuity of the physical parameters involved and the problem of lattice mismatch, the domain decomposition methodology has been employed for our numerical (nonlinear) analysis. Chebyshev pseudospectral methods have been used for discretization in each sub-domain. Our results demonstrate clear jumps in the electric field and strain distributions across the interface between the two materials, while the mechanical field and electric displacements exhibit a continuous pattern. The effect of electrostriction has been analyzed by comparison of the results with a linear model (without electrostriction). Finally, we demonstrate a significant difference in several key parameters of nanostructures, such as the electric field and strains, while analyzing them with our multidimensional model and previous one-dimensional models.",

    "abstract": "Due to their unique optoelectronic properties and a wide range of current and potential applications, nano-sized semiconductors have attracted much attention in recent years. Among these semiconductors, cadmium sulfide (CdS), being one of the most important wide-gap semiconductors, is stable and exhibits high luminescence [1]. CdS nanostructures have found many applications in photovoltaic cells, photonic switches and optoelectronic devices. In recent years, CdS quantum dots have also been used in biolabeling, bioimaging, drug delivery and other biotechnological areas. It is due to these optoelectronic and bio-related applications, the analysis of thermal stability of CdS quantum dots becomes one of the most important avenues of research in this field. Additionally, CdS quantum dots represent an intermediate state of matter between molecular species and bulk materials. Therefore, a better understanding of their temperature dependent phase stability and phase transformations will ultimately enable us to taylor their electrical and optical properties from molecular level to bulk crystals.\nIt has been known for a long time that the bulk CdS is highly stable and it exists in the hexagonal wurtzite phase in a wide range of temperatures, from room temperature to its melting point 1750°C. Recently it has been shown that due to the large surface to volume ratio and reconstruction of surface crystal structure, the thermodynamic properties of the CdS nanostructure can differ significantly from bulk CdS [2]. For example, under appropriate conditions some wurtzite structure semiconductor materials can transform into a graphitic structure when they are in the form of thin nanoplates [3]. Since the internal pressure deduced from surface stress is very large for nanostructures, at ambient conditions, the stability phase in nanosize structures is always a high pressure stability phase struture in bulk [4]. Nevertheless, the temperature-dependent phase stability of the CdS quantum dots remains poorly understood to date. In particular, systematic calculations and comprehensive comparisons of their thermodynamic stability, as well as mechanical, electronic, and optical properties under different temperature conditions are still lacking. To fill this gap, in this work we carry out first-principle molecular dynamic (MD) calculations for CdS quantum dots of various phase structures and study temperature-dependent phase stability of these nanostructures. Based on our calculations, we analyze the relative stability of different CdS phases under different temperature conditions. Our results indicated that at the temperature range studied in this work, the phase stability sequence for the Cd48S48 nanostructure is rocksalt, wurtzite and graphitic phase, which is the same as that of bulk CdS crystal under high pressure. Although the temperature can affect the total energy of the CdS nanostructure, it cannot change the phase stability sequence of CdS nanostructures in the temperature range studied in this work.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a simplified mesoscopic model for the analysis of nanowires of finite length. Our interest has been motivated by the fact that such nanowires can exhibit shape memory effects. This has been confirmed for a wide range of these structures, including ZnO, Cu, Ni, Al, Ag, and Au nanowires.\nHere we focus on a two-dimensional analogue of what in the general three-dimensional case would correspond to cubic to tertragonal or tetragonal to orthorhombic transformations. Such a two-dimensional case deals with square to rectangle transformations which are easier to treat due to the fact that the energy as a function of lattice spacing exhibits two distinct minima corresponding to two different phases of the nanostructure.\n\nMost results obtained up to date, both theoretical and computational, are concerned with infinitely long nanowires or infinitely large nanoplates for that matter. In this contribution, we develop a relatively simple and computationally inexpensive model to study phase transformations in finite nanostructures with our major focus given to nanowires of finite length. We note the models describing shape memory effects at the mesoscopic level such as those developed in [1] can be reduced to a two-dimensional case (and in the case of nanowires of infinite length, to the one-dimensional case). Our considerations are based on a modification of a coupled system of PDEs for the evolution of displacements and temperature [2,3]. One of the applications of the nanowires discussed in this paper stems from their integration in biomolecular technologies and we highlight the importance of the contributions of entropic elasticity in such cases.\n\nRecently, we developed and demonstrated the application of several efficient methodologies to solve two-dimensional models describing square-to-rectangle phase transformations in materials with memory, in particular the finite volume methodology [3] and a numerical reduction procedure based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) [2]. The methodology proposed in this contribution is different and is based on a combination of the Chebyshev pseudo-spectral technique combined with the domain decomposition method and second order backward differentiation. Based on this methodology, we analysed different types of nanowires and examplified our results here with Cu nanowires for different diameter-length ratio. Our results indicate that the initial pattern formation propagates towards the longitudinal boundaries of the structure when the nanowire width decreases. Based on our computational results, we provided an explanation of this phenomenon, confirming that in all cases studied here surface energy suppresses the pattern formation.",

Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of these imperfections on linear electromechanical properties and on flexoelectricity. The constitutive relations for the adiabatically insulated reversible system are derived from the total differential of the general thermodynamic Gibbs potential. The mechanical and electrical balance equations coupled through the constitutive equations are then solved with finite element method for the defective nanostructures. We focus in our study on GaN-based nanostructures which are important in electronic and optoelectronic applications. They exhibit higher magnitudes of electric field compared to other semiconductors in similar contexts. Our results are presented for GaN quantum dots embedded in an AlN matrix. ",

In order to study thermal stress effects on electromechanical properties we develop a fully coupled generalized 3D model. We consider the nanowire superlattices having alternate layers of GaN and AlN in an AlN matrix.  The resulting electromechanical properties are then incorporated in the 8-band k-dot-p Hamiltonian to calculate the bandstructure of GaN/AlN NWSLs. Next, we analyze the effect of various thermal loadings up to 1000 K on electromechanical properties and subsequently on electron localization. It is observed that the thermal loading results in strain in addition to the lattice mismatch induced strain. Since GaN/AlN are piezoelectric and pyroelectric in nature, thermal stresses also have a significant effect on the internal electric field. The thermoelectromechanical properties are observed to modify significantly the bandstructure properties of the GaN/AlN NWSLs.",

We use a fully coupled thermoelectromechanical formulation, consisting of balance equations for heat transfer, electrostatics and mechanical field. To estimate the vertical transport current in the heterostructures, we have developed a multi-physics model incorporating thermionic emission, thermionic field emission, and tunneling as the current transport mechanisms. A wide range of thermal (0-300 K) and pressure (0-10 GPa) loadings has been considered. The results for the thermopiezoelectric modulation of the barrier height in these heterostructures have been obtained and optimized. The calculated current shows a linear decrease with increasing pressure. The linearity in pressure response suggests that Al[subscript x]Ga[subscript 1-x]N/GaN heterostructure-based devices are promising candidates for pressure sensor applications under severe environmental conditions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new design configuration for a carbon nanotube (CNT) array based pulsed field emission device to stabilize the field emission current. In the new design, we consider a pointed height distribution of the carbon nanotube array under a diode configuration with two side gates maintained at a negative potential to obtain a highly intense beam of electrons localized at the center of the array. The randomly oriented CNTs are assumed to be grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin film. A model of field emission from an array of CNTs under diode configuration was proposed and validated by experiments. Despite high output, the current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper is focused on understanding this problem. The random orientation of the CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are modeled to explain the self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Pulsed field emission current at the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation by considering a dynamic electric field across the cathode and the anode and integration of current densities over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. Furthermore we compare the subsequent performance of the pointed array with the conventionally used random and uniform arrays and show that the proposed design outperforms the conventional designs by several orders of magnitude. Based on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the device current history are reported. ",

Here, on an example from the credit risk analysis of multiple correlated firms, we develop a fast Monte-Carlo type procedure for the analysis of complex systems such as those occurring in the financial market. Our procedure is developed by combining the fast Monte-Carlo method for one-dimensional jump-diffusion processes and the generation of correlated multidimensional variates.

    "abstract": "Phase transformations are ubiquitous in many problems of science and engineering where we have to analyze the evolution of complex nonlinear systems. In this contribution, we focus on one class of such problems that are brought about by smart materials and structures technologies where materials with shape memory effect have found numerous applications at different spatial scales. We provide a brief historical context to the subject, classifications of phase transformations, and their applications. We consider a general three-dimensional model of dynamic nonlinear thermoelasticity, based on a coupled system of partial differential equations derived within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, which we apply to study the dynamics of materials with shape memory and associated phase transformations. We provide details of key mathematical difficulties in analyzing this model numerically. We briefly discuss the most efficient numerical techniques in this context, including conservative numerical approximations based on the modified integro-interpolational methodology where in addition to the interpolation of the solution with respect to independent variables, we also perform the Steklov averaging of nonlinear terms. Our focus is on a mathematical model and its numerical discretization which we construct to analyze the wave propagation in materials with shape memory. From a mathematical point of view, the result is a system of coupled nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations, known as the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire system. The effect of internal friction on wave propagation patterns is analyzed under shock loadings implemented using stress boundary conditions. For practical numerical simulations the constructed model of coupled nonlinear system of partial differential equations can often be reduced to a system of differential-algebraic equations, where the Chebyshev collocation method can be employed for the spatial discretization, while backward differentiation can be used for the integration with respect to time.\nIn the last part of this paper, we discuss a relatively simple and computationally inexpensive model to study phase transformations in finite nanostructures with our major focus given here to nanowires of finite length. We show that in the latter case, the models describing shape memory effects at the mesoscopic level can be reduced to a two-dimensional case and we demonstrate our results on the example of the cubic-to-tetragonal transformations (approximated by square-to-rectangular transformations in the two-dimensional case). Our results were obtained under the conditions of the full coupling between thermal and mechanical fields. This new feature of our model extends recently reported phase-field-based models for studying microstructures and shape memory effects at the nanoscale level where thermal field coupling was neglected. We demonstrated the existence of a critical dimension for finite length nanowires exhibiting shape memory effects. Representative examples of modelling were given for nanowires of different widths showing the importance of geometrical constraints in studying the properties of nanowires.",

Up to date, these effects have typically been neglected in modeling microstructures at the scales of interest considered here. Nanowires of length 2000 nm and widths ranging from 200 nm to 50 nm are simulated to study the effect of size on the microstructure evolution. There exists a critical width below which the size effect is prominent. We present a series of numerical results demonstrating this phenomenon.

    "abstract": "In a series of recent papers we demonstrated that coupled electro-mechanical effects can lead to pronounced contributions in band structure calculations of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures (LDSNs) such as quantum dots, wires, and even wells. Some such effects are essentially nonlinear. Both strain and piezoelectric effects have been used as tuning parameters for the optical response of LDSNs in photonics, band gap engineering and other applications. However, these effects have been largely neglected in literature while laterally coupled quantum dots (QDs) have been studied. The superposition of electron wave functions in these QDs become important in the design of optoelectronic devices as well in tayloring properties of QDs in other applications areas. At the same time, laterally grown QDs coupled with electric and mechanical fields are becoming increasingly important in many applications of LDSN-based systems, in particular where the tunneling of electron wave function through wetting layer (WL) becomes important and the distance between the dots is treated as a tuning parameter. Indeed, as electric and elastic effects are often significant in LDSNs, it is reasonable to expect that the separation between the QDs may also be used as a tuning parameter in the application of logic devices, for example, OR gates, AND gates and others. In this contribution, by using the fully coupled model of electroelasticity, we build on our previous results while analyzing the influence of these effects on optoelectronic properties of QDs. Results are reported for III-V type semiconductors with a major focus given to GaN/AlN based QD systems.\n",

We use the model developed in our earlier work to study the microstructure and mechanical properties of finite length nanowires. The phase field model with the Ginzburg-Landau free energy is used to model the phase transformation based on the chosen order parameter. The governing equations of the thermo-mechanical model are solved simultaneously for different loading cases. We observe that nanowire behaves in a stiff manner to axial load with complete conversion of the unfavorable martensite to the favorable one. The bending load aids the phase transformation by redistributing the martensitic variants based on the local axial stress sign. The nanowire behavior to multi-axial (axial and bending together) is stiffer axially than the axial loading case. The understanding of the behavior of nanowire to multi-axial loading will be useful in developing better SMA-based MEMS and NEMS devices.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a detailed analysis is presented of a quasi one-dimensional parabolic nanowire formed in the plane of a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The nanowire is modulated by a longitudinal periodic potential which has a form of truncated Fourier co-sines. The Hamiltonian of the wire is rotated in such a way that the non-diagonal part of the total Hamiltonian can be treated as a perturbation. Based on the second order perturbation theory, the energy spectrum of the electron spin states of a III-V semiconductor nanowire was found. The analytically obtained energy spectrum was compared to those values obtained from a numerical method. For numerical simulations, the corresponding eigenvalue problem based on the finite element method was solved.\nIt was also found that the energy spectrum curves of the electron with opposite spins differed by one quantum number (i.e., the first and second excited states) cross each other with the accessible values of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. The crossing point was investigated using both theoretical and numerical methods. Next, it was confirmed that the crossing point can be manipulated towards the Gamma or L points with the application of Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. It was demonstrated that the crossing point can be found for relatively larger values of k in GaAs nanowires compared to the corresponding values in InAs nanowires. It is concluded that in GaAs nanowires, the spin splitting energy is mainly dominated by the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, whereas in InAs nanowires, the spin splitting energy is mainly dominated by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.",

    "abstract": "Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) grown on substrates are potential electron sources in field emission applications. Several studies have reported the use of CNTs in field emission devices, including field emission displays, X-ray tube, electron microscopes, cathode-ray lamps, etc. Also, in recent years, conventional cold field emission cathodes have been realized in micro-fabricated arrays for medical X-ray imaging. CNT-based field emission cathode devices have potential applications in a variety of industrial and medical applications, including cancer treatment. Field emission performance of a single isolated CNT is found to be remarkable, but the situation becomes complex when an array of CNTs is used. At the same time, use of arrays of CNTs is practical and economical. Indeed, such arrays on cathode substrates can be grown easily and their collective dynamics can be utilized in a statistical sense such that the average emission intensity is high enough and the collective dynamics lead to longer emission life. The authors in their previous publications had proposed a novel approach to obtain stabilized field emission current from a stacked CNT array of pointed height distribution. A mesoscopic modeling technique was employed, which took into account electro-mechanical forces in the CNTs, as well as transport of conduction electron coupled with electron–phonon induced heat generation from the CNT tips. The reported analysis of pointed arrangements of the array showed that the current density distribution was greatly localized in the middle of the array, the scatter due to electrodynamic force field was minimized, and the temperature transients were much smaller compared to those in an array with random height distribution. In the present paper we develop a method to compute the emission efficiency of the CNT array in terms of the amount of electrons hitting the anode surface using trajectory calculations. Effects of secondary electron emission and parasitic capacitive nonlinearity on the current-voltage signals are accounted. Field emission efficiency of a stacked CNT array with various pointed height distributions are compared to that of arrays with random and uniform height distributions. Effect of this parasitic nonlinearity on the emission switch-on voltage is estimated by model based simulation and Monte Carlo method.",

For this case, we formulate the Kane-type model and based on it we study the properties of dots by using both analytical and finite element techniques. It is shown that that in semiconductor quantum dots, the electron spin states in the phonon-induced spin-flip rate can be manipulated with the application of externally applied anisotropic gate potentials. The spin flip rates can be enhanced by such potentials, which can also reduce the level crossing points to lower quantum dot radii. We provide numerical examples providing further insight into these new findings where it is evident that these observed effects are due to the suppression of the g-factor towards bulk crystal. Based on these findings, the phonon induced spin-flip rate can be controlled through the application of spin-orbit coupling.

In precision engineering, these materials are used, for example, for automatic alignment of optical systems. In SMA actuators, we often use hysteresis compensation for high-precision positioning, so that SMAs can be applied for control and vibration tuning of various structures. In vibration tuning in many of these applications, it is often necessary to apply supplementary oscillators to absorb the vibration energy input into the primary system. In this contribution we highlight how, due to the thermo-mechanical coupling, the vibration characteristics of the supplementary oscillator can be tuned by changing its temperature. The basis is our dynamic nonlinear model of SMA oscillator which has been simplified for the vibration analysis. At low temperatures, the SMA oscillator behaves as a regular damper by using its dissipation due to mechanically induced phase transformations.",

On the first step of our procedure, the resulting strain-dependent two-band Hamiltonian model in effective mass approximation is solved for wurtzite AlN/GaN QDs numerically. Then the wavefunctions for three lowest levels, obtained from our first step, are employed to calculate the dipole moment matrix elements. Finally, the density matrix approach is used for calculation of susceptibility. The feasibility of controlling susceptibility is studied under the influence of electromechanical effects on quantum dot optical properties. Among other things, we demonstrate that electromechanical effects induce blue shifts in the resonance peak of susceptibility in wurtzite quantum dots under the study.",

We have analyzed such characteristics as the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), the radius of gyration, the number of hydrogen bonds per base pairs, and the ionic distribution around the surface of the RNA nanocluster under study in different solutions. The variation of energy and temperature with simulation time have also been studied for all sets of simulations. The change in these features with the nature of solution has also been studied.",

Specifically, in our current study we present the nulcear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the bacteriochlorophyll that is directly taken from the FMO complex, as well as the spectrum for this system for its optimized geometry. We use density functional theory to calculate the optimized geometry and the NMR spectra of the bacteriochlorophyll. From our calculations we found that the chemical shift values are slightly lower for the optimized geometry of the bacteriochlorophyll than the values obtained for the unoptimized bacteriochlorophyll. The differences observed between these two spectra are due to the fact that the unoptimized structure of the bacteriochlorophyll possess the influence of the protein environment of FMO complex.",

Therefore, we model the RNA nanotubes of different sizes using molecular dynamics simulations and then study the mechanical properties of such nanotubes with continuum models implemented with the finite element methodology. We present details of our novel discrete-to-continuum models, and explain how the atomistic models in this field can be used to develop the continuum macroscopic models which would allow to calculate elastic properties of RNA nanotubes using the finite element method.

Firstly, a phenomenological thermodynamic analysis based on a Landau-type elastic Gibbs energy is carried out, which gives a guidance for further investigations. Then, the state-of-the-art phase field model is implemented to study the hysteretic nonlinear phenomena involved in the energy harvesting process. The influence of different materials is carefully compared and discussed. Furthermore, the combined effects of the bias electric potential and bias resistance in different materials are presented and discussed in the context of future real implementations.\n",

For the fully optimized structure of bacteriochlorophyll, we have calculated the NMR spectra by using the same level of DFT approximations, as well as the basis set, as it was done for the original structure.  From the obtained results, we observe that the patterns of the NMR chemical shift are same in both cases, but there is a small shift in the peaks of the NMR spectra for the optimized system from the values of the original structure. Among other conclusions, it is important to emphasize that the effect of the protein environment on the bacteriochlorophyll taken from the FMO complex has a significant effect, as seen from the changes in the NMR spectra. This sensitivity of physical properties with respect to the structural change are very important for our better understanding the applications of photosynthetic bacteria in biomedicine, as well as their limitations.",

Using mathematical modeling tools to study microstructures can predict the behaviors of material under applied fields. In the current paper, a 1-D dynamic isothermal model is proposed to simulate the microstructure of SMA via Legendre wavelets collocation method. Because of the good performance of Legendre wavelets basis, this method shows good properties in both precision and stability. This paper gives a detailed numerical algorithm and employs the backward differentiation formula to perform all simulations. Computational simulations are carried out in both static and dynamic systems to study the stress induced phase transformation (PT). Numerical experiments are performed using different grids in this paper to demonstrate the advantages of reduced computing cost of the proposed method. In addition, good convergence of the method is well illustrated by the numerical results. The microstructure of SMA is well captured in the current paper.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a parametric study has been conducted to evaluate the effects of frequency and duration of the short burst pulses during pulsed radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating chronic pain. Affecting the brain and nervous system, this disease remains one of the major challenges in neuroscience and clinical practice. A two-dimensional axisymmetric RFA model has been developed in which a single needle radiofrequency electrode has been inserted. A finite-element-based coupled thermo-electric analysis has been carried out utilizing the simplified Maxwell’s equations and the Pennes bioheat transfer equation to compute the electric field and temperature distributions within the computational domain. Comparative studies have been carried out between the continuous and pulsed RFA to highlight the significance of pulsed RFA in chronic pain treatment. The frequencies and durations of short burst RF pulses have been varied from 1 Hz to 10 Hz and from 10 ms to 50 ms, respectively. Such values are most commonly applied in clinical practices for mitigation of chronic pain. By reporting such critical input characteristics as temperature distributions for different frequencies and durations of the RF pulses, this computational study aims at providing the first-hand accurate quantitative information to the clinicians on possible consequences in those cases where these characteristics are varied during the pulsed RFA procedure. The results demonstrate that the efficacy of pulsed RFA is significantly dependent on the duration and frequency of the RF pulses.",

A generalized three-dimensional heterogeneous computational model comprising of muscle, bone and target nerve has been considered. The continuous RFA has been performed through the monopolar needle electrode placed parallel to the target nerve. Finite-element-based coupled thermo-electric analysis has been conducted to predict the electric field and temperature distributions as well as the lesion volume attained during continuous RFA application. The quasi-static approximation of the Maxwell’s equations has been used to compute the electric field distribution and the Pennes bioheat equation has been used to model the heat transfer phenomenon during RFA of the target nerve. The electrical and thermo-physical properties considered in the present numerical study have been acquired from the well-characterized values available in the literature. The protocol of the RFA procedure has been adopted from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved commercial devices available in the market and reported in the previous clinical studies. Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity along with the piecewise model of blood perfusion have been considered to correlate with the in-vivo scenarios. The numerical simulation results, presented in this work, reveal a strong dependence of lesion volume on the target nerve location from the considered bone. It is expected that the findings of this study would assist in providing a priori critical information to the clinical practitioners for enhancing the success rate of continuous RFA technique in addressing the chronic pain problems of bones.",

    "abstract": "Lead-free piezocomposites represent an environmentally friendly route for sensing\nmechanical stimuli and for interconversion of electrical and mechanical energy. Current lead-free composites lag state-of-the-art lead-based composites in terms of performance. A major\napproach to bridge this gap is to devise design strategies to enhance the piezo-response of lead-free composites. Fundamental to this is the understanding of the roles of various physical\nprocesses which are conventionally overlooked. From a modelling perspective, it is necessary\nto develop refined models which account for non-local and non-linear effects, which could have significant roles in deciding the response of the composite. This paper develops such refined electro-elastic models considering the flexoelectric and electrostrictive contributions to the piezo-response in addition to the linear piezoelectric response. The roles of these non-local and non-linear contributions are studied on a simple architecture consisting of a BaTiO3 inclusion within a polymer matrix. Insights obtained through this model will be further used to develop efficient piezoelectric composites.",

This paper discusses the computational design of microstructured lead-free polymer-based piezoelectric nanocomposites suitable for production by 3D printing. Results are presented and further analyzed for various configurations using BaTiO3 inclusions in polymeric matrices enriched with the addition of carbon nanotubes (CNT). By incorporating carbon nanotubes in the matrix, we anticipate a quite significant improvement in the piezoelectric response of the composite, through simultaneous hardening of the matrix and improvement in its permittivity.",

A fully coupled electro-mechanical model has been developed for conducting the comparative analysis considering three different cases, viz., no degradation, 50% degradation and 90% degradation of elastic modulus of the microtubule. The microtubule has been subjected to dynamic forces adopted from the commonly used loading-unloading conditions in nanoindentation experiments. The results show that the degradation of microtubules significantly influences their electro-elastic response when subjected to externally applied forces. The transient response of the model in terms of induced displacement, electric potential and volumetric strain has also been analyzed for different magnitudes of mechanical degradation. The modelling study presented here represents a more accurate electro-mechanical model compared to the classical mechanical model for quantifying the effects of mechanical transductions on microtubules biomechanics.",

A three-dimensional computational model of a microtubule has been developed for predicting the electro-elastic response of the microtubule subjected to external forces. The effects of the magnitude and direction of the applied forces on the mechanics of microtubule have been evaluated. In addition, the effects of variation of microtubule lengths on the electro-elastic response subjected to external forces have also been quantified. The results of numerical simulation suggest that the electro-elastic response of microtubule is significantly dependent on both the magnitude and direction of the applied forces. It has been found that the application of shear force results in the attainment of higher displacement and electric potential as compared to the compressive force of the same magnitude. It has been further observed that the output potential is linearly proportional to the predicted displacement and the electric potential within the microtubule. The increase in the length of microtubule significantly enhances the predicted piezoelectric potential under the application of different forces considered in the present study. It is expected that the reported findings would be useful in different avenues of biomedical engineering, such as biocompatible nano-biosensors for health monitoring, drug delivery, noninvasive diagnosis and treatments.",

In this contribution, we report a fully coupled thermo-electro-mechanical model for a more accurate prediction of the treatment outcomes during the radiofrequency cardiac ablation. A numerical model comprising of cardiac tissue and the cardiac chamber has been developed in which an electrode has been inserted perpendicular to the cardiac tissue to simulate actual clinical procedures. Temperature-dependent heat capacity, electrical and thermal conductivities, and blood perfusion rate have been considered to model more realistic scenarios. The effects of blood flow and contact force of the electrode tip on the efficacy of a fully coupled model of RFA have been systematically investigated. The numerical study predicts that the efficacy of RFA is significantly dependent on the thermo-electro-mechanical parameters of the cardiac tissue. ",

During this procedure, part of dysfunctional tissues is ablated by using the heat, typically generated from medium frequency electric current. It is a field of medicine where mathematical and computational models play a substantial role in assisting clinical practitioners with quantifications of some of the most critical characteristics, including temperature distributions and ablated volumes. In this contribution, we describe a framework for the development of coupled thermo-electro-mechanical models in this field. While our framework and the described validation procedures can be applicable to a variety\nof ablation modalities and treatments, a major focus has been given to some of the particularities related to cardiac ablation at tissue-cellular scales and a role played by cell organelles such as microtubules, as well as by the cell nucleus. We have discussed the effects their inclusion makes on the calculation of the main characteristics of the radiofrequency ablation procedures. The importance of domain heterogeneity, as well as the integration of fluid-structure interaction in the developed framework along with other effects, have been highlighted and the details on ablation modalities in the context of clinical experimental\nresearch have been given.

In particular, it is well known  that  along  with  amyloid-beta,  the  tau  protein  is  also  drivingAlzheimer’s disease. Multiscale reaction-diffusion models can assist in our better understanding of the evolution of the disease. Based on a coarse-graining procedure of the continuous model and taking advantage of the brain data connectome, a computationally challenging network mathematical model has been described where the edges of the network are the axonal bundles in white-matter tracts. Further, we have modified the heterodimer model in such a way that it can now capture some of nthe critical characteristics of this evolution such as the conversion time from healthy to toxic proteins. Finally, we have analyzed the modified model theoretically and validated the theoretical findings with numericalsimulations.",

    "abstract": "To model reliably behavioral systems with complex bio-social interactions,accounting for uncertainty quantification, is critical formany application areas. However,in terms of the mathematical formulation of the corresponding problems, one of the ma-jor challenges is coming from the fact that corresponding stochastic processes should, inmost cases, be considered in bounded domains, possibly withobstacles. This has beenknown for a long time and yet, very little has been done for thequantification of uncer-tainties in modelling complex behavioral systems described by such stochastic processes.In this paper, we address this challenge by considering a coupled system of Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describing interactions between active andpassive participants of a mixed-population group.  In developing a multi-fidelity mod-elling methodology for such behavioral systems, we combinelow- and high-fidelity resultsobtained from (a) the solution of the underlying coupled system of SDEs and (b) simu-lations with a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kineticMonte Carlo procedure. Furthermore, we provide representative numerical examples ofhealthcare systems, subject to an epidemic, where the main focus in our considerationsis given to an interacting particle system of asymptomatic and susceptible populations.",

We use such nanoscale GO structures as a benchmark example for our studies here. MBTR and SOAP representations are employed in a general-purpose ML model to analyze the effect of long-range interactions in GO. Finally, a physics-based ML model allows us to build interatomic potentials for 2D and 1D systems.

The third generation of ANNs, namely, spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neurons enable a more realistic mimicry of the human brain. A large class of the problems from these domains is characterized by the necessity to deal with the combination of neurons, spikes and synapses via integrate-and-fire neuron models. Motivated by important applications of the integrate-and-fire of neurons in neuromorphic computing for bio-medical studies, the main focus of the present work is on the analysis of the effects of additive and multiplicative types of random input currents together with a random refractory period on a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) synaptic conductance neuron model. Our analysis is carried out via Langevin stochastic dynamics in a numerical setting describing a cell membrane potential. We provide the details of the model, as well as representative numerical examples, and discuss the effects of noise on the time evolution of the membrane potential as well as the spiking activities of neurons in the LIF synaptic conductance model scrutinized here. Furthermore, our numerical results demonstrate that the presence of a random refractory period in the LIF synaptic conductance system may substantially influence an increased irregularity of spike trains of the output neuron.",

Recent studies have shown that information in WM is not only maintained through persistent recurrent activity but also can be stored in activity-silent states such as in short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP). Motivated by important applications of the STSP mechanisms in WM, the main focus of the present work is on the analysis of the effects of random inputs on a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) synaptic conductance neuron under STSP. Furthermore, the irregularity of spike trains can carry the information about previous stimulation in a neuron. A LIF conductance neuron with multiple inputs and coefficient of variation (CV) of the inter-spike-interval (ISI) can bring an output decoded neuron. Our numerical results show that an increase in the standard deviations in the random input current and the random refractory period can lead to an increased irregularity of spike trains of the output neuron.",

    "abstract": "One of the keys to understanding and treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia is believed to be calcium (Ca2+ ) in the cytoplasm. Researchers have discovered how an imbalance of Ca2+ ions in the cytoplasm can lead to cell death and, more particularly, neurodegeneration in brain cells in Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. Many substances are present in brain cells, but Ca2+ is the most tractable and is employed for experimental validations. In this study, we employ a spatio-temporal computational model to investigate AD development using Ca2+ dynamics in the cytoplasm. We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of biochemical processes via a new coupled model and analyze the sensitivity of this model to some of the critical parameters. As a result of this study, several important contributions have been made. Firstly, we have demonstrated that the SERCA pump flux parameter has a significant impact on the frequency of intracellular calcium concentrations. Furthermore, we studied Ca2+ dynamics with diffusion in the presence of different amyloid-beta levels. We found that how amyloid-beta affects various fluxes contributions through voltage-gated calcium channels, amyloid-beta-formed channels and ryanodine receptors. This work contributes to a better understanding of the spatio-temporal action of Ca2+ dysregulation in the cytoplasm, and through this, it can offer further insight into AD developments and progression.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are a particular type of glial cells observed throughout the gray matter in the brain. In a healthy brain, they help to defend evolutionarily conserved astrogliosis programs and maintain neuronal metabolism. On the other hand, in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affected brain, they release neurotoxins because of the adopting behaviours of different functions depending on the disease progression. Along with astrocytes, amyloid-beta (Aβ ) and tau proteins (τ P) play a prominent role in AD. In this paper, we have developed a model and have studied the dual action of astrocytes with Aβ , τ P, and their toxic forms in the brain connectome. Initial conditions-dependent solutions of the model demonstrate that the treatment depends on AD’s status at the first diagnosis time. With an increase in the clearance rate of toxic Aβ by the astrocytes, the model predicts a cure possibility from AD. Furthermore, the network model with non-uniform parameter values in different regions, developed here, provides a better insight into the distributions of the concentrations in the brain connectome.",

    "abstract": "One in six of the world’s population has to deal with neurodegenerative disorders, and while medical devices exist to detect, prevent, and treat such disorders, some fundamentals of the progression of associated diseases remain ambiguous. In this contribution, we focus on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins are among the main contributors to the development or propagation of AD. The Aβ proteins clump together to form plaques and disrupt cell functions. Moreover, the abnormal chemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the neuron’s transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in the brain by clearing the Aβ toxic plaques. Even so, over-activated astrocytes release chemokines and cytokines and also react to pro-inflammatory cytokines, further increasing the production of Aβ. We have provided details of a novel coupled mathematical model that can capture astrocytes’ dual behaviour, emphasizing the importance of spatio-temporal coupling and nonlocality. We have demonstrated that the disease propagation depends on memory effects, that is the disease’s earlier status, which involves non-Markovian processes. We have explained how to integrate brain connectome data in the network model and to study this effect, as well as the dual role of astrocytes as a coupled phenomenon. Depending on toxic loads in the brain, we have also discussed details of the analysis of the neuronal damage in the brain. We have explained how the memory effect can slow down the propagation of toxic proteins in the brain, decreasing the rate of neuronal damage. Representative numerical examples have been given, and special attention has been paid to nonequilibrium considerations and stochastic modelling frameworks in the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

These cells contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (CNS), exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS, and maintain a healthy balance in the brain. However, over age, these cells fail to control the healthy balance of the proteins and cause different neurodegenerative diseases, one of which is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In AD, insoluble amyloid-beta plaques accumulate in the extracellular space along with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) inside the brain cells. In this paper, we have developed a model and studied the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and NFTs along with an antiamyloid-beta therapy applied in the treatment of the disease. Based on these studies, we have demonstrated the dynamics of the modelling therapy such that the drug helps clear a subsequent amount of amyloid-beta plaques in each dose. Numerical simulations have been used to show different long-term outcomes of the model. To further analyze the disease progression in the brain and its treatment, we have integrated brain connectome data in the network model as part of our developed modelling framework.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of social human dynamics would be a powerful tool to improve nearly any computational endeavour that involves human interactions. This includes intelligent environments featuring, for instance, efficient illumination systems, smart evacuation signalling systems, intelligent transportation systems, crowd control, or disaster response. Moreover, given that the human population has significantly grown up in number and spread across the planet, the capacity to predict social human behaviours will help to demonstrate special behavioural forms observed when masses of people gather together and make crowds. Additionally, human crowd dynamics are characterized by complex psychological and sociobiological behaviour. The contributions of psychological factors need to be accounted for to obtain more reliable models. Many models have been proposed to describe the social human group dynamics in different scenarios. However, due to the complexity of such systems amplified by the above factors, social human decision-making with multiple choices has not been fully scrutinized. In this chapter, we consider probabilistic drift-diffusion models and Bayesian inference frameworks to address this issue, assisting better social human decision-making. We provide details of the models, as well as representative numerical examples, and discuss the decisionmaking process with a representative example of the escape route decision-making phenomena by further developing the drift-diffusion models and Bayesian inference frameworks. In the latter context, we also give a review of recent developments in human collective decision-making and its applications with brain network models. Furthermore, we provide illustrative numerical examples to discuss the role of neuromodulation, reinforcement learning in decision-making processes. Finally, we call attention to existing challenges, open problems, and promising approaches in studying social dynamics and collective human decision-making, including those arising from nonequilibrium considerations of the associated processes.",

It is crucial to switch to sustainable renewable energy sources for various uses to address the challenges of depletion and environmental degradation. The use of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers for hydrogen production is one of the intriguing solutions that have a lot of potential. Incorporating basic thermodynamics and electrochemical relationships, this chapter gives the mathematical equations and models that relate to PEM electrolyzers. The research takes into account the well-known Butler-Volmer kinetics for the electrodes and transport resistance within the polymer electrolyte, and it concentrates on a simplified PEM electrolyzer. The investigation looks at how temperature affects the ionic conductivity, resistance, and operational cell voltage of the polymer electrolyte. Various exchange current densities are also included. Specifically, the resistance decreases from 0.438 Ω/ cm2 at 298 K to 0.161 Ω/cm2 at 373 K. Conversely, a slight increase in ionic conductivity is observed. This observation suggests that the membrane assembly’s ionic conductivity improves with temperature, which consequently enhances the hydrogen flow rate.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative condition marked by the gradual degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which causes motor and non-motor symptoms. Understanding the dynamics of Parkinson’s disease progression and evaluating treatment techniques necessitates a complete assessment of the nonlocal character of the bioneurological mechanisms involved. This research explores a novel approach to model PD progression by integrating nonlocality into analysing bioneurological processes. Nonlocality in this context refers to the interdependence of the disease progression as the long-term memory. In addition, we have investigated the impact of the two therapeutic interventions on the dynamics of PD, the reduction of extracellular -synuclein and controlling the activated microglia. Our findings suggest that the memory effect delays the onset of Parkinson’s disease.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we address the challenges associated with accurately determining gaze location on a screen, which is often compromised by noise from factors such as eye tracker limitations, calibration drift, ambient lighting changes, and eye blinks. We propose the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to smooth the gaze data collected during eye-tracking experiments, and systematically explore the interaction of different system parameters. Our results demonstrate that the EKF significantly reduces noise, leading to a marked improvement in tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our proposed stochastic nonlinear dynamical model aligns well with real experimental data and holds promise for applications in related fields.",
