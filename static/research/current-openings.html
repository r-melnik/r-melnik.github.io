<p align="justify" >Applications are invited for a Research Associate / Postdoctoral Position at the M3AI Lab, Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, ON, Canada. The Lab is part of the MS2Discovery Interdisciplinary Research Institute. The successful candidate will be part of the research program in mathematical modeling and computational & data sciences at the Laurier M3AI Lab and MS2Discovery Institute, and will contribute substantially to at least one of the following research areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiscale coupled models in physics, engineering, and materials science, including multifunctional smart materials driving eco-friendly technologies;</li>
  <li>Computational neuroscience, neurogenesis, brain networks and multiscale models, related areas of life sciences; </li>
  <li>Machine learning and other data-dependent methods, with target application areas, including, but not
    limited to, biomedicine, nanotechnology, and energy;</li>
  <li>Complex systems and networks in social dynamics, interplay between social and biological factors, uncertainty quantification for multiscale problems; </li>
  <li>Inverse problem approaches for complex systems and their applications. </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify" >The search is not limited to the above areas, although experience in one or more of these areas, as well as with high performance computing, molecular dynamics simulation, coupled modeling including such tools as Comsol, and visualization tools, will be considered<strong>&#160;a strong advantage</strong>&#160;and may be given priority. Applicants should possess&#160;a recent PhD degree in such disciplines as physics/biophysics, engineering, applied mathematics or computational science&#160;and&#160; have a demonstrated interest and experience in scientific computing, including high performance computing and visualization. Proven ability to work independently and experience in software applications and development in the above context are considered to be important assets for this position. <br>
  The appointment is funded by the Canada Research Chair program as part of the continual development of interdisciplinary research in the areas of mathematical modeling, computational & data sciences at Laurier.&#160; The position is for one year in the first instance, with the possibility of extension. Ability to quickly adapt to new scientific environment, demonstrated research productivity, as well as good personal and communication skills are assumed for this position.</p>
