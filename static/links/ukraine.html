  <br>
Ukraine is the homeland of one of the most ancient civilizations, the
Trypillian Civilization, which flourished on its territory about 7,000
years ago. To put it into context, recall that we are now living in the
geologic time period &nbsp;known as the Holocene. &nbsp;This epoch,
which began only about 11,000 years ago, came after the Pleistocene
epoch. The later period started about 2-1.8 million years ago and its
end indicated the last glacial period (or the last Ice Age) on the
Earth.&nbsp; Trypillian Civilization is an archeological name for the
Mesolithic/Early Neolithic culture that existed on the territory of
present-day Ukraine since about 5400 BC. According to scholars, the
largest Trypillian cities that existed over six thousand years ago are
described as "hundreds of hectares in area, thousands of dwellings, and
a population estimated at 10,000-15,000 people. The strong
fortification, which was made of hundreds of two and even three-story
buildings densely attached one to the other, protected the inhabitants.
The population of these cities was engaged primarily in agriculture,
although there were also craftsmen such as potters, blacksmiths, and
weavers".&nbsp; Evidence of pottery &nbsp;during the Early Neolithic
period is usually associated with the rise of agriculture and sedentary
living.&nbsp; The Trypilia plastic arts, namely portraits, are unique
masterpieces. Some other features of the Trypilian Civilization are the 
  appearance and the use of writing. A developed sign system, created by the Trypilians, was the step to the creation of writing. Some from more
than 300 signs are similar to Sumerian such as "star", "plant",
"house". Trypilians used clay tokens - similar to those used in
Mesopotamia.&nbsp; The Trypilian settlements grew in the areas often in
access of 400 hectares with large houses more than one story high -
there was nothing similar to be found anywhere else in Europe. In the
ancient Egypt it was the Predynastic period. Similar to the Trypilian
Civilization, from the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age) - beginning
about 4000 BC - Egyptians apparently utilized an extended part of the
land.&nbsp; Pottery, found in the Upper Egyptian tombs from the 4th
millennium BC, was known to the Trypilian people at that time. Other
known Early Neolithic cultures include the Hemudu culture (5000-4500
BC) in Zhejiang Province and Yangshao culture in North Central China.
During the same time, many regions in Europe experienced essential
environmental effects after the last Ice Age &nbsp;ended, prolonging
the Mesolithic transitional (between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic)
period in those areas. Such conditions delayed the coming of the
Neolithic period in many parts of Europe, and until as late as 4000 BC
in Northern Europe. </span></font><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">The Trypilia culture extended from the lands east of 
  the Dnipro river near present-day Kiev through the southwest steppe areas of 
  Ukraine, and to an area just southwest the Siret river, in present-day Romania. </font>

  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Trypillian culture is named after the small village of 
  Trypillia (south of Kiev) has yielded evidence of copper technology and a 
  distinctive pottery painted with vigorous wavelike patterns in black and 
  white. During the Neolithic 
  period of 5000-1800 B.C. the sophisticated Trypilian culture was the most advanced in all of Europe and 
  influenced the early Greek and Aegean civilisations.</span></p>

  <font face="Times New Roman">
  <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
  During the Bronze, the 
  Iron and the Middle Ages, there were numerous nomadic incursions into the 
  steppe regions of Ukraine before the rise of the Antes civilization on the 
  territory of present-day Ukraine. Over its history, many were attracted by the 
  fertile lands of Ukraine.&nbsp;
  This ancient land remembers many civilizations and while many&nbsp; promoted 
  the cultural enrichment, others brought wars and devastations on its territory.&nbsp; 
  The location of Ukraine on the western edge of the vast Eurasian steppe, the 
  largest expanse of flatland on earth,&nbsp; meant that Ukraine would become a 
  part of Eurasian nomadic life. Nomadic pastoralists, including those from the 
  east and the west, appeared early in the Ukrainian steppes.&nbsp; Cimmerians, Scythians, Taurians, Sarmatians, 
  Goths, Greek city-states of the northern Black Sea coastal area and the Crimea 
  left a notable trace in the history of Ukraine.&nbsp; Some researchers admit 
  that&nbsp; there is a great deal of confusion with regard to the names of the 
  various peoples who appeared in the steppe country north of the Black Sea from 
  the day of the Cimmerians (1000-700 BC).&nbsp; One of the reasons is that some 
  researchers argue that Cimmerians were native to Ukraine. In his Odyssey, 
  Homer referred to the northern Black Sea shore of present-day Ukraine as&nbsp; 
  "the land of Cimmerians".&nbsp; To put it into a historic context, around that 
  time, probably between 
  900 and 800 BC, the Italian peninsula was settled by the first sedentary 
  people prior to Romans, the Etruscans, and later in 753 BC Rome was founded by 
  Romulus. As the Greek mainland had become overpopulated by about 1000BC, a 
  number of city-states sprung in the northern Black Sea shore of present-day 
  Ukraine in the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC. &nbsp;The other major part 
  of population were&nbsp; Scythians described by the Greek "father of history" 
  Herodotus who visited the land of present-day Ukraine.&nbsp;

  Scythians became noticeable in Ukraine around 800 BC as they superseded from Black Sea coast 
  Cimmerians, and had created several empires, the first one is  dated back 
  to the 8th - 7th c. BD.&nbsp; It is known that on the right bank of the Dnipro 
  river lived an agricultural people, also known as Scythians, as described by 
  Herodotus. The Ukrainians themselves can be traced to the Neolithic 
  agricultural tribes in the</span></font><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

  Dnipro and Dnister valleys who created one of the 
  most advanced Civilizations at the time, the Trypilian Civilization.&nbsp; As 
  believed by some scholars, the agricultural people, described by Herodotus at 
  the Scythian period of Ukraine, could be direct ancestors of the proto-Slavs. 
  The Scythians of Ukraine came into trade contacts with Greek culture via 
  city-states of the northern Black Sea coastal area and the Crimea. Along with 
  trade contacts, the Mediterranean world brought a war to Ukraine when the 
  Persian king Darius invaded the country in 513 BC, but was defeated.&nbsp; The 
  people represented a strong power which was sufficient to repel&nbsp; an 
  invasion by the Persian king.&nbsp; After that the 2nd empire was created in 
  the 4-th century B.D. Ukraine. This was the period 
  of board of king Atej which marked epoch of the best cultural rise.  </span>&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Well

  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The 
  third Scythians empire, created in Ukraine in the 3-rd c. BD, &nbsp;had its centre 
  in Crimea. &nbsp;Its economy was based on export of bread to Greece. The Crimean 
  Scythian state extended from the lower Dnipro river to the Crimea with 
  Scythian Neapol as their capital city (near present day Simferopol in 
  Ukraine). This formation of the 
  state was strongly suffered from 
  invasions of Sarmatians and Goths tribes. The rise of Macedonia has also 
  contributed greatly to the fall of the Scythian empires, in particular to the 
  2nd empire. After the defeat of the Persian king, the Scythians expanded their 
  influence to Thrace&nbsp; (in the late 5th and early 4th c. BC) where their 
  interests clashed with the interests of Philip of Macedon who wanted to settle 
  Macedonian towns along the routes as far north as the Danube.&nbsp; In the 
  spring of 339 AD, the Macedonians clashed with the Scythians near Danube where 
  the latter were defeated.&nbsp; It is after this battle, on the way home 
  Philip suffered a severe injury which left him permanently lame and all the 
  booty was lost due to a Thracian Triballians' attack. In 343 BC Pilip hired 
  Aristotel for 3 years as the teacher for his son, known later to the history 
  as Alexander the Great. In 338 BC in the battle of Chaeronea the Greek 
  city-states were decisively defeated and submitted to Macedonia, while in 334 
  BC the Persian Empire suffered a major defeat in the battle of the Ganicus 
  River.&nbsp; During the Alexander the Great reign,&nbsp; Macedonia held sway 
  not only Greece and Egypt, but practically all of the Middle East and parts of 
  western India. In Ukraine, the 3rd Scythian empire created the 3rd c. BD&nbsp; 
  was coming to an end. Scythians were overrun by Sarmatians and only a small 
  group of Sythians remained in Crimea. The Scythian Neapol was destroyed much 
  later, in the 5th century AD, by the Goths.&nbsp; Culturally, 
  Scytho-Sarmatians left a noticeable trace not only in the history of Ukraine, 
  but also in the history of other European nations. Images from 
  Scytho-Sarmatian mythology could be found later in the Celts, the Goths, and 
  the Scandinavians.&nbsp; The Goths, who probably originated in southern 
  Scandinavia, had poor lands and </span><font color="#ffffff">

  <font face="Times New Roman">on the edge of the new era numerous overpopulated tribes started migrating 
  south. These Germanic tribes initially inhabited lands in northern Europe, in Scandinavia, 
  Low Countries and Jutland, and started their invasions southward from the 
  Baltic Sea.&nbsp; At around 200 BC the Goths invaded Rhineland where the Celts 
  lived and defeated them.&nbsp; Although the Roman Empire at that time just 
  finished the Second Punic War, the danger coming from the north was noticed. The first conflict between 
  Romans and Germanic armies happened in the 2nd century BC in Dacia.&nbsp;</font>

  middle steppe, and the Black Sea coast on the south. In the northern and 
  northwestern wooded plains lived the agriculturalists, the oldest inhabitants 
  of the land who were military weak. The only way to expand for them was to the 
  south in Ukraine, given good trading relations with the Scythians of Ukraine 
  and the fact that to the west there were very aggressive and numerous Germanic 
  tribes, and to the east there was just a vast swampy wood region inhabited by 
  Finnish hunters.&nbsp; However, this integration of Ukrainian lands did not

an empire that contributed greatly to the fall of the Roman Empire.
Further to the West, the Goths, the Vandals and others presented also
an increasing threat to the Roman empire, and the Roman army of Valens
was eventually defeated by the Goths at Adrianople in 378 AD. This
happened at the time of severe clashes between the Goths and the Antes
in Ukraine. After several victories in the East and the West, the
Vandals and other barbarian tribes crossed the Rhine in 406 AD and
barbarian settlement began to expand over much of Europe. Europe, from

  during the Earlier Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 8). The Huns were founding 
  strongholds all over the land and were preparing for a jump into Western 
  Europe, while Ukraine, once again in its history, became a borderland between 
  the East and the West. The Hunns were making repeated incursions into the Roman Empire 
  during the 4th and 5th centuries ad. These attacks culminated in a series of 
  wars under Attila, the most renowned of its leaders, that brought both parts 
  of the Roman Empire, East and West, to the verge of collapse. </span>

  the city of Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople, a move that changed 
  the history for many years to come. It was him who endorsed Christianity as

  many centuries.&nbsp; </span>

  </font>
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">that 
  the earliest inhabitants of the area can be traced back at least to the ages 
  of&nbsp; Trypillian Civilization&nbsp; of the Neolithic period (5400-1800 B.C.).&nbsp; 
  Excavations continue to uncover many artifacts from settlements dating from 
  the Copper, Bronze, and Iron ages. The ancient chronicles and legends speak of 
  three Slavik Polianian princes (Kyi, Shchek, and 
  Khoriv)  who founded the 
  settlements on the hills overlooking the Dnipro River.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyi, their 
  elder brother, is especially mentioned in many legends and his name lives on in the name of the city, Kyiv. </span>

  <font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">
  As we mentioned above, Kyiv with the settlements around it that go back to the 
  Trypillian culture, has an even longer history. &nbsp;It 
  is known, for example, that the Apostle Andrew, St Peter's brother, was the first to bring 
  news of Christian faith to the Ukrainian lands as early as the 1st century AD 
  (around AD 60/70). St Andrew first arrived to the Crimea from where he 
  proceeded along the Dnipro river and was fascinated by the spectacular 
  location of the hilly shores of the Dnipro river where now modern city of Kiev 
  stands. He erected a cross on the site where the Church of St Andrew is 
  currently located.&nbsp; Many other Ukrainian cities have equally long and 
  colourful history. Among others, the history of southern Ukrainian cities such as Feodosia, 
  Kirkinitida (destroyed by the Goths), Chersoneses (modern Sevastopol),&nbsp; 
  Evpatoria and many others goes back to the Ancient Greece time. When St. 
  Andrew came to Ukraine in the 1st c. AD, those days Ukraine had three distinct 
  geographical zones with different types of societies. Around that time other 
  Slavic tribes appeared to differentiate themselves from the others. The 
  so-called autochthonic&nbsp; theories claim that some of the Slavs had lived 
  north of the Carpathian Mountains well before 1000 BC. It is clear that during 
  the movement of the Goths to extend their lands to the agriculturally rich 
  areas of Europe, including Ukraine, the Slavik identity had sharpened.&nbsp; 
  The people needed to differentiate themselves from the invaders, hence the 
  word "Slav" which in the Old Slavonic language means "word, talk" (slovo) to 
  indicate people who understand each other&nbsp; in contrast to the Goths whom 
  they called "dumb, speechless people" (nimi, nimtsi).&nbsp; The common root 
  word "slava" means "glory" or "praise". In the wake of foreign invasions, a 
  number of Slavik states appeared at that time, e.g. Karantania (in today's 
  Austia and Slovenia), the Bulgarian first empire (681AD), Great Moravia, and 
  others. The English as an ethnic group can also trace their heritage back&nbsp; 
  to around that time as they sharpened their identity from the&nbsp; Germanic 
  (Anglo-Saxons) tribes who came to occupy most of&nbsp; lowerland Britain by the 7th 
  Century AD. In the late 6th and early 7th century the first fortification 
  appeared in the northern section of Old Kiev Hill. Eventually, while the court 
  of the princes was located in the hills of Kiev, the lower part of the city, 
  known as Podil, developed into a busy trading district.&nbsp; In the battles

  nations appeared on the scene.&nbsp; Norsemen of Scandinavia grew into a 
  fearful force in Europe.&nbsp; Among others, the Danish tribes under their leader Frode&nbsp; 
  faced the Huns in 430 AD. Later, in 515 AD they attacked the Frankish empire. 
  Over the coming years they raided English, French, Slavik, and Spanish 
  territories.&nbsp; Most historians believe that the violent Viking Age begins 
  when </span><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">in
June 793 AD Norsemen plunder the monastery on the Island of
Lindisfarne, off the east coast of England, killing many of the monks
there and enslaving others. The assault shocked Europe. In 810AD Danish
Vikings attacked the Frisian (the Netherlands) coast, then part
of&nbsp; Charlemagne's Frankish empire.&nbsp; In 830 AD Norwegians
established themselves in Ireland. That angered Danes and led to a
subsequent wars. While Danes and Norwegians raided to the West, the
Swedes made a number of raids to the South and East.&nbsp; Sweden was
first mentioned by Roman historian Tacius in the 1st c AD.&nbsp; Trade
exposed the Scandinavians to the wealth of other nations and fed dreams
of plunder and conquest.&nbsp; The oldest town in Scandinavia, Birka in
Sweden,&nbsp; was founded late in the 8th century (around 860 AD),
followed by other towns such as Ribe in Denmark in the 9th century.
Unlike in their homeland, Swedes who came to Ukraine in the 9th
century, saw already well developed cities. They were coming to a rich
and immense country. Apart from Kiev, many Ukrainian cities have
thousands years history and cities such as Rivne were built at least in
the 2-3 century AD or earlier. Since their inhabitants were mainly
agricultural people those cities, however, were very vulnerable to
foreign invasions and the timing of Swedes' arrival to Ukraine
coincided with frequent attacks of Khazars who continued devastating
the Ukrainian territory. As it was in other parts of&nbsp; Europe, the
Scandinavians in Ukraine were largely employed as hired warriors.&nbsp;

Already in the 5th century Kyiv grew as an important trading post and
the formation of Kiev Rus dates back to the 6th century.&nbsp; With the
arrival of the Varyags (Vikings) to the Ukrainian lands about two
centuries later this state was strenghen. Well before the Swedes came
to Ukraine, the inhabitants of Kiev Rus were called "rusyny" - a
designation that remained in use in some parts of Ukraine until recent
times. There was no a Swedish tribe with a similar name and the main
reason for some historians' claim that the word Rus has Scandinavian
origin is that&nbsp; the Finns called the Swedish Ruotsi. However, it
is well known that well before the Varangian route to the Bizantines
had been established, the name of present day Ukraine was referred as
Ros and it was mentioned, for example, in connection with the Hunnic
attack of 434-437AD, before the Huns invaded Italy in 452. The land of
the Polianians around Kiev was bounded by the Dnipro, Irpin, and Ros
rivers and the latter, originated from the Old Slavik word "rosy"
(morning dew),&nbsp; lend the name to the people inhabiting the land
from prehistoric times. Like the locals, the Swedes who arrived to
Ukraine and became&nbsp; inhabitants of the Kiev Rus were also called
"rosy", "rusyny". They helped to free Ukrainian lands from Khazars and
that created conditions for the establishment&nbsp; on the territory of
the present day Ukraine the most powerful state in Europe. </font></p>

  (Variags) were Vikings who promoted trading, piracy and mercenary militarism 
  and who roamed the
  river systems and portages of Europe, reaching the Caspian Sea and 
  Constantinople. </span><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">The Varangians who travelled eastwards, arrived to 
  Ukraine from beyond the Baltic Sea around the mid 9th century. Scandianavians 
  gradually merged with the local population of Ukraine and were called Rusyny. 
  Some of the most famous anscestors of Rusyn were Rurik, Askold, and Dir.&nbsp;Although 
  it is often stated that Askold and Dir were Rurik's brothers, the Primary 
  Chronicle implies that they were neither his relatives nor of noble blood.&nbsp; 
  There are various theories concerning the causes of the Viking routes.&nbsp; 
  It is clear that Askold and Dir were travelling to Constantinople and when 
  they saw a settlement on a mountain near the Dnipro river, they fell in love 
  with the city. They settled in the city and gathered a large number of fellow 
  Varangians. Askold and Dir earned respect of the locals as they helped to 
  strengthen the Ukrainian land and freed it from the Khazars. The new state 
  became stronger and in 865-866 the warriors led by Askold and Dir attacked the 
  Bizantium Empire aiming to seize Constantinople. Patriarch Photius described 
  this attack as a "thunderbolt from heaven". According to the legend, the 
  defenders offered up prayers to God and dipped the Honourable Robe of the 
  Mother of God into the sea. A sudden storm drowned the fleet of the Princes of 
  Kiev in the sea of Marmora. In view of this miracle, Askold and Dir assumed 
  Christianity and, back in Kiev, ordered the foundation of the St Elijah Church 
  (located by the rivers Dnipro and Pochaina), the place where Christianity was 
  introduced to Kievites later in 988 AD by St Volodymyr (980-1015).&nbsp; As it 
  was mentioned, year 793 is often considered as the beginning of the Viking 
  Age. After 793 Vikings continued on small-scale raids across England, but in 
  865 a larger army led by Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan, Guthrum (and other 
  "landless" kings) arrived to East Anglia. York was the center of the kingdom 
  of Jorvik from around 866. By 874 the Vikings of Denmark got control of 
  northern and eastern England. In parallel with their expansions to the British 
  Isles, the Vikings raided the vast territory of present day Russia from as 
  early as the 7th-8th century. For example, Ynglin Saga recounts the tale of 
  the semi-legendary Ivar Vidfadmi (ca 650-700) who drowned on an expedition to 
  the present day Russia, the area around Lake Ladoga. </font>

  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;There 
  is evidence to suggest that a Swedish settlement, Aldeigjuborg, was established
  around Lake Ladoga in the 8th century. </span>
  <font face="Times New Roman" color="#FFFFFF">U</font><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">p 
  until ca 800 the Dnipro route for the Varangians was often blocked by the 
  Avars, who invaded frequently Ukrainian lands, the easier pickings were in the 
  Volga basin (see e.g., H.R. Whinfrey).&nbsp; One of the theories suggests that 
  the Vikings would plant crop after the winter, and go raiding as soon as the 
  ice melted on the sea, then returned home with their loot, in time to harvest 
  the crops. During the Viking Age they were wandering raiders and mercenaries.&nbsp; 
  It should be noted that between ca 830-853 Ireland was disputed between the 
  Norwegians and the Danes. In 853 the Danes were defeated by the Norwegian 
  warlord Olaf. Norway was eventually united under King Harold (I) the 
  Fairhaired of Vestfold. These disputes between the Vikings and the process of 
  the unification of Norway, according to many historians,&nbsp; were 
  contributing factors to the Vikings invasions and expansions. The bulk of the 
  Vikings were displaced warriors who had been driven out of their lands and who 
  had nowhere to go. Their frequent raids to the Lake Ladoga and the Volga basin 
  led to the establishment of a union of northwestern Russian lands with the 
  center of Novgorod in about 860 AD. The Varangians warriors could protect 
  those lands from the Mongols and Turks and Rurik became the first prince (knyaz') 
  of Novgorod (860-879).&nbsp; Rurik himself&nbsp; is often considered of Swedish descent, but some historians assimilate him 
  with the Danish Rorek of Jutland.&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Some 
  &nbsp;historians claim that he was in fact both Slav and
  Scandinavian. &nbsp;</span><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">After 
  his death in 879, Rurik was succeeded by Oleg, the oldest member in his 
  family. It was Oleg (879-912) who moved his army to Kyiv, put Askold and Dir 
  out of the way by an act of treachery, and made Kyiv the capital of the state 
  known to the history as the Kievan Rus.&nbsp; Two main historical events 
  followed shortly afterwards. On the one hand, the Vikings continued their 
  raids on European cities and&nbsp; in 885-886 the Danes laid siege to Paris. 
  The siege was lifted only when the French guaranteed the Vikings clear passage 
  up the river Seine and 700 pounds of silver. On the other hand, a new growing 
  force on the European scene emerged when in 907 Oleg reached the gates of 
  Constantinople, the great city of the Bizantine Empire. He obliged the 
  emperor to pay a large tribute and to agree to a treaty of the free commerce 
  between the Kievan Rus and the Greeks. The kings that followed consolidated 
  the Kievan Rus and the dynastic links between Ukrainian 
  and Scandinavian rulers were maintained for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiev 
  prospered as the center of the powerful and prosperous state that was known to 
  the outside world as Kievan Rus. By the 10th century, the state was the 
  largest and most powerful state in Europe.&nbsp; It was a state where many 
  nations lived in harmony so much desired in today's fragile world. The 
  Scandinavians in the Kievan Rus were not only employed as hired warriors but 
  also as diplomats. The texts of the 907, 911, and 944 treaties between Kievan 
  Rus and Byzantium bear witness that among state's envoys were people with 
  Scandinavian names. </font>

  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">After 
  the reign of Igor (912-945), the first princess of Kiev became Olha 
  (945-962) who glorified her two royal predecessors by 
  building Churches on their graves, that of St Nicholas on Askold's grave and 
  that of St Sophia on the grave of Dir. &nbsp;To these days, the "Grave of Askold" 
  is a great national monument of Ukraine, a part of the park complex on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kiev.
  Olha also introduced a series of laws governing agriculture, hunting seasons 
  and the like. &nbsp;She clearly insisted on a common code of laws and regulations 
  to be accepted and obeyed by all her subjects. The widespread personal serfdom characteristic of Western Europe states did 
  not exist in Kievan Rus.
  "Olha the Wise" as she was and still is called also extended diplomatic hands 
  westward toward Europe while enhancing trading routes into Asia.
  It was Olha who laid the path for her great grandson, St Yaroslav the Wise, to marry off his daughters to the 
  Royal Houses of Europe, thereby establishing enduring connections with them. 
  Nevertheless, the danger of attacks from antagonistic tribes, in particular 
  the Turkic Pechenegs and the Khazars rtemained. Around 965, the prince 
  Svaytoslav I (962-972) attacked the Khazars and captured their capital, Atil, 
  moving this tribe to the Bosphorus coast of the present day Turkey.&nbsp; 
  While the relationships between Kievan Rus and Bizantine empire were not 
  always easy, it was during the reign of Volodymyr I when emissaries were sent 
  from Kievan Rus abroad to report on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam before 
  Orthodoxy was chosen for the people of Kievan Rus. </span>

  Prince Volodymyr&nbsp; maintained traditionally good relationships with other

  addition to the domestic struggles, both Denmark and Sweden were attempting to 
  acquire Norwegian territory. The juvenile prince of Norway, Olaf Tryggvason, 
  the nephew of Volodymyr's grandee Sigurd, and his mother were given refuge in 
  Kyiv. Sigurd rescured the 9-year old Olaf, who was held captive in the Baltic 
  lands, and brought him to Kievan Rus where he was a loyal servant to the court 
  of Grand Prince Volodymyr. In 995, Olaf I, a great-grandson of Harold I, 
  became the new king of Norway.&nbsp; He was killed in a battle with combined 
  Danish and Swedish forces. The disordered Norway was re-united by Olaf II (Olaf 
  Haraldsson or Olaf the Holy, 995-1030).&nbsp; It was Olaf II who introduced 
  Christianity to Norway during his reign between 1014 and 1028. Although </span>

  the Holy was married to Astrid, the sister of Yaroslav the Wise's wife, 
  Ingigerda.&nbsp; By about 1025, Olaf the Holy was more powerfulthan any 
  previous Norwegian king had been.&nbsp; However, in 1028 he was defeated by an 
  alliance of powerful nobles with king of England and Denmark, Canute II, and 
  took excile in Kievan Rus where he lived between 1029 and 1030.&nbsp; Olaf the 
  Holy's son, Magnus Olavsson, was fostered by Ingigerda and Yaroslav the Wise 
  and he lived in Kiev. Later, he became the king of Norway (1035-1042) and from 
  1042 also of Denmark. In 1046 Magnus made his uncle Harold Haardraade coruler 
  and after Magnus' death in 1047, Harold became king as Harold III. Harold III 
  (Harold Hard Ruler) sought the daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, Elizabeth, in 
  marriage and he wrote the Song of Joy dedicated to her. The Scandinavian sagas 
  tell us of his visit to Kievan Rus in 1031. He served as a retinue chief in 
  the court of Yaroslav the Wise and was one of the Varangian Guards in 
  Byzantium (to Konstantin IX Monomachus), before he was allowed to marry 
  Elizabeth, upon his return to Kiev in 1043. This romantic story is documented 
  in Scandinavian and Ukrainian sources (e.g., Snorri Sturluson, Ivan Franko).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  This marriage has a far reaching political consequences as it led to a 
  temporary alliance between Harald III and the future king of Denmark, Earl 
  Svein Ulfsson, as Books of the Sagas and Knytlinga Saga emphasize. Elizabeth, 
  the daughter of KIev Prince Yaroslav the Wise, remained the Queen of Norway 
  for over 20 years (1043/44 - 1066). After Harold III was killed in the battle 
  of Stamford Bridge, she married the Danish king Svein. Harold III and 
  Elizabeth had two daughters, Maria and Ingigerda.&nbsp; Yaroslav was in close contact with 
  other European dynasties as 
  his other two daughters (great-great-granddaughters of St Olha) were married 
  to Andrew I of Hungary, and 
  Henry I of France.</span></p>

  particular in 1107 and 1111.&nbsp; Invaders were decisively 
  defeated and gradually during the regn of&nbsp; Volodymyr II Monomakh 
  (1113-1125) they were pushed back toward the Volga River.&nbsp; He had 
  enormous respect of Ukrainian people as well as abroad. He was not only a fine 
  statesman but also a quotable writer. Around 1117 he wrote his famous "Poucheniie 
  ditiam"&nbsp; (Instructions for my children) where he described his life and 
  what it took to be a good person. He still managed to hold the regions of 
  Kievan Rus together, the task that was increasingly difficult. Volodymyr 
  Monomakh is buried in Kiev in St Sophia Cathedral.&nbsp; The relations between 
  Kievan Rus and Europe, remained strong after Volodymyr II Monomakh, during the 
  reign of his son Mstyslav (1125-1132).&nbsp; By his mother Mstyslav was a 
  descendant of an English royal family (Gytha of Wessex). His wife Christina 
  was the daughter of the Swedish king Ingi Steinkelsson (ingold I). Mstyslav 
  figures prominently in the Norse Sagas (under the name Harald), taken to 
  allude to his grandfather. Harold II of England. Mstyslav's daughters Ingeborg 
  of Kiev was married to Canute (Knut) Lavard of Jutland (c 1090 -1131, Danish 
  prince and Duke of South Jutland), and was mother to Valdemar I of Denmark. 
  Mstyslav's daughter Malmfrid was married to Sigurd I of Norway (c. 1090 - 
  1130). Sigurd I (Jordsalsfare) was the last king of the line of Harold III. 
  His rule lasted from 1103 until his death, after which Malmfrid married Eric 
  II. She was the queen of Denmark between 1135 and 1137 during the reign of 
  Erik Ermune. Mstyslav's daughter, Euphrosyne of Kiev, married King Geza II of 
  Hungary, while his daughter&nbsp; Eupraxia married Alexius Comnenus, son of 
  John II Comnenus (John the Beautiful, Byzantine emperor from 1118 to 1143).

  Kiev was an alluring prize not only for foreign invaders but for home grown 
  princes. The seventh son of Volodymyr (II)&nbsp; Monomakh was Yuri Dolgorukii 
  ("the long-armed"). The name of his mother is unknown. Born in the last decade 
  of the 11th century, he ruled over the Rostov-Suzdal lands in his father's 
  life time. At around 1125 he was sent to be prince of Suzdal (present day 
  Russia) and with him begins the lineage of Suzdal (Vladimir) princes.&nbsp; In 
  1108 he married a daughter of Polovtsi Khan Aepi, Anna. He started building 
  city-fortresses on the roads leading into the depths of the Suzdal lands.&nbsp; 
  The cities of Yuriev-Polski on the river Koloksha, Pereyaslavl-Zalesskii, 
  Dimitrov, and the walls around Moscow with a moat were all built in the course 
  of one historical period between years 1147-1156. The first reference to 
  Moscow as a town dates back to 1147 and the reign of Yuri Dolgoruki was the 
  dawn of the future Russian empire.&nbsp; The glory of Kiev, however, did not 
  allow Yuri Dolgoruki to rule his lands in piece (hence his sobriquet of "Dolgorukii") 
  and already in 1147 he resumed his struggle for Kiev in order to make Suzdal 
  dominant. Two years later, in 1149, he captured Kiev, but was driven out of 
  the city by his nephew Izyaslav. In 1155 he recaptured Kiev again and ruled 
  for two years before his death in 1157 (he is interred at the Saviour Church 
  of Berestovo in Kiev). The same year Kievites led an anti-Suzdalian uprising. 
  Some historians believe that many fortresses, including the wall around 
  Moscow, were not built by Yuri himself, but rather by his oldest son, Andrei 
  (Andrew the Pious, 1111-1174) who was later named Bogolubski.&nbsp; Yuri 
  proclaimed his son Andrei a prince of Vyshgorod (near Kiev), but he left 
  Vyshgorod for Vladimir in 1155. After his father's death in 1157 he became 
  prince of Vladimir, Rostov, and Suzdal. He attacked Kiev in 1169, savagely 
  sacked and looted the city. The Chronicle calls this worst disaster to have 
  befallen on Kievan Rus as not even Polovtsy caused that much damage. Relations 
  between the city-states broke down completely after that, and lawless became 
  the rule. For centuries Kiev could not recover from this destructive raid.&nbsp; 
  After the destruction of KIev, he continue to strengthen Vladimir-Suzdal 
  principality and demanded a tribute from Dvinskaya population.&nbsp; Andrew 
  built a castle at Bogolubovo, near Vladimir (hence his nickname) and he 
  conflicted with outstanding boyars by taking away most of the power of his 
  rivals by default.&nbsp; The result of these conflicts was a plot against him 
  and he was killed by the boyars at Bogolubovo in June 1174. As Vladimir grew 
  to become Russia's dominant city in the late 12th - early 13th centuries, the 
  absolute monarchy that was typical of Andrei Bogolubski in governing the 
  principality became a model for Russia's tyrants in future ages.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In 
  1206 the tribes of Mongolia were united under Genghis Khan to form the most 
  formidable military force of the Middle Ages. They went unheralded in Europe 
  while devastating northern China and Central Asia. The eastern borders of the 
  former Kievan state were attacked at around 1221 and the troops of weakened 
  princes combined with some Polovstian forces were defeated at the battle of 
  Kalka in 1223. Ukrainian lands, including Kiev, were next on the list, but 
  encountering stiff resistance on the south from the Bulgars, the Mongols 
  unexpectedly left Europe. After Gengis Khan death, the Mongols continued their 
  devastating raids in Asia, conquering Iran, Korea, and more of China.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  They returned to Europe in the winter of 1236-1237 led by Batu Khan, the 
  grandson of Gengis. They brought with them 150,000 troops (2/3 of them 
  Turkish) and siege equipment and catapults they learned from Chinese. By 1238, 
  the Bulgar kingdom on the Volga, cities of Ryazan,&nbsp; Suzdal, Moscow, and 
  Vladimir all fell. By 1239 Polovtsi forces were destroyed and in 1240 the 
  Mongols were standing at the walls of KIev.&nbsp; At that time, just 
  before the Tatar-Mongol invasion, Kiev belonged to the Galician-Volhynian 
  kingdom. The history of the Ukrainian flag goes back to those days when under the blue and yellow flag, the 
  Ukrainian armies, led by Danylo of 
  Halych, defeated the German princes in 1237-1238 near the town of Drohobych. The heroic defense of Kiev, led by 
  Dmytro who had been dispatched by Danylo of Halych, against the 
  armies of the khan was undertaken under the blue and yellow flag. The city 
  fell in December 1240 with the last resistance continued along the walls of the Desiatynna 
  Church.&nbsp; The fall of Kiev </span><font color="#ffffff">
  <font face="Times New Roman">that served as a

  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;However, 
  combined armies of Germany, Poland and Bohemia were defeated and Batu set up a 
  new base in Hungary to move further west. Allegedly, the death of Batu's 
  uncle, Khan Ugedey, who died in Mongolia saved the rest of Europe from that 
  wave of the most devastating Mongol invasion.&nbsp; Since Batu was a candidate 
  for Gengis Khan's throne, he called off the campaign and began the 5,000-mile 
  journey east, sparing the rest of Europe from an invasion it could not have 
  resisted for long. However, </span><font face="Times New Roman">after 
  the Mongol raiders in the 12th and 13th centuries invaded Ukraine, the state 
  gradually declines. </font> </font></p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">Halych-Volynia was the local successor of Kievan Rus and 
  was ruled by the descendants of Yaroslav the Wise and Volodymyr Monomakh. 
  Danylo reestablished himself in Volynia in 1221.&nbsp; Although in 1241 the 
  Mongols passed through Halych-Volynia, they have not devastated them as badly 
  as other Ukrainian lands. Danylo visited Batu's capital at Sarai on the Volga 
  at about 1246 and ensured that Halych-Volynia would be spared of closed 
  supervision by the Mongols. In 1253 he received a royal crown&nbsp; from the 
  Pope and was crowned king by a papal representetive in Dorohochyn on the Buh 
  River.&nbsp; He founded new cities, including Lviv in 1256, named after his 
  son Lev, and fortified many others.&nbsp; In 1254 he attempted to retrieve 
  Kiev from the Mongols, but was unsuccessful. The Mongols moved to 
  Halych-Volynia, and although Danylo could not get rid of the Mongol yoke, he 
  managed to keep Mongol influence to a minimum. Danylo was active in the 
  affairs of central Europe. He died in 1264 and considered by many historians 
  as one of the most outstanding Ukrainian rulers produced by western 
  principalities. The 
  Mongolian empire brought&nbsp; suffering and cruelty to the people of Ukraine, 
  but another group of people who took advantage of the Mongol invasion to the 
  Ukrainian lands were Lithuanians who did not unite into one state until the 
  middle of the 13th century, when they came under attack from the Teutonic 
  Knights. They expanded rapidly in the east and&nbsp; south, including the 
  western half of Ukraine to where they moved in 1340 during the reign of 
  Algirdas, the son of the Lithuanian prince Gediminas. In 1362 his troops 
  occupied Kiev and moved to Podilia. In the same 1340, the Polish king&nbsp; 
  Casimir moved into Ukrainian lands of Halych principality. It was possible 
  after a treaty on the conquest of Ukraine between him and Louis of Hungary 
  just a year before this invasion. Despite resistance led by Dmytro Detko and 
  others, by 1349 Casimir&nbsp; occupied Halych and part of Volynia.&nbsp; The 
  Ukrainian lands were the reason for several decades wars between the Poles, 
  aided by Hungarians, and the Lithuanians as only in 1387 Halych were finally 
  annexed to the Polish crown.&nbsp; It was a period of creation of new 
  political structures in Europe with the Kalmar Union that united Denmark, 
  Norway and Sweden in 1389 as an example. Recall also that the Union of Krevo 
  (present day Belorus) was signed between Poland and Lithuania. As a result, 
  The Lithuanians were converted to Catholicism and that not only stopped the 
  crusades from the west but allowed the marriage of the Lithuanian king to the 
  queen of Poland, and hence the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian state that 
  included much of the Ukrainian lands. To make the matter worse, in 1482 the 
  city of Kiev was invaded by Crimean Tatars as the Ukrainian lands on the south 
  were occupied by the Crimean Khanate.&nbsp; At the same time, at around 1480, 
  the principality of Moscovy based in Moscow was able finally to break free 
  from the Mongols after many years of resistance. The rise of Russia was deeply 
  disturbing to the Polish-Lithuanian state which was transformed into a 
  Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) by the Union of Lublin in 1569. Despite a series 
  of uprisings, noticeably in 1508 under Mykhailo Hlynsky,&nbsp; the Ukrainian 
  lands remained formally in the Polish-Lithuanian state while being frequently 
  attacked by the Tatars and their Ottoman Turkish overlords.&nbsp; Recall in 
  this context that it was already in 1453 when the Ottoman Turks under Mehmet II captured Constantinople 
  and in 1461 the Ottomans conquered Trebizond, the last Greek state. The 
  Ottoman empire was restored at the doorstep of Europe.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The Ukrainian spirit was revitalized&nbsp; in 
  the movement of the Ukrainian Cossacks and the Ukrainian state was eventually 
  reborn after the war of independence of 1648.&nbsp; The word Cossack refers to 
  the free, masterless men. The Cossacks appeared first around 1480 and by the 
  mid 16th century their number became significant. The Ukrainian Cossacks lived 
  along the Dnipro river and its lower tributaries and beyond Kaniv and Cherkasy. 
  They formed groups (vatahy) and they had their leaders (hetman). They lived in 
  fortified camps known as "sich" and fend off Ukrainian lands from attacks of 
  Tatars and Ottoman Turks. They were often employed as guards and Cossackdom 
  became a full-time, year-round occupation from not later than 1520.&nbsp; In 
  1529 the Muslim Turks (called in Ukraine bisurmany) devastated Hungary and had 
  almost captured Vienna. The danger of the Turks and Tatars was real and Europe 
  understood that. At around 1553-54 Dmytro "Baida", a Kaniv's official, 
  gathered several groups of Cossacks and below the Dnipro rapids built a fort 
  to prevent raids of Tatars to the Ukrainian lands. This was the foundation of 
  what is known to the history as the Zaporizhska Sich. Many Cossacks lived also 
  in the frontier towns such as Kaniv. Although the Commonwealth refused to 
  support Cossacks in their crusades, they wanted to harness them by attracting 
  them into service and forming Cossacks' units.&nbsp; Such units of registered 
  salaried&nbsp; Cossacks were formed at around 1572 by King Sigismund and 
  around 1578 by King Stefan Batory. By 1589 there were around 3,000 registered 
  Cossacks and 40,000-50,000 nonregistered. The Cossacks started raids against 
  the Ottoman empire as early as 1538 (Ochakiv's raid).&nbsp; The Cossacks were 
  recognized and respected force in Europe in the wake of the Ottoman danger to 
  Europe. It is known, for example, that Erich von Lasotta was sent as an envoy 
  to the Sich by the Habsburgs of Austria. The Sich existed as though it was a 
  sovereign power, a strong unit of Ukrainian spirit surrounded by foreign 
  occupants. Around 1600-1620 the main military efforts of the Cossacks were 
  directed against the Ottoman empire. They even managed to destroy the 
  Constantinople harbour and according to a 17th century Ottoman historian, 
  Naima, the Cossacks were the people who were "unmatched in sea-warfare by 
  anyone in the world".&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sultan Osman II moved to the 
  Commonwealth,&nbsp; 40,000 Cossacks led by Hetman Sahaidachny, saved the 
  Polish army from a complete annihilation.&nbsp; During numerous successful 
  military campaigns, Cossack self-confidence grew. Hetman Sahaidachny perceived 
  the Cossacks as potential leading force in Ukraine and in 1620 he enrolled 
  himself and the entire Zaporizhska Host in the Kievan brotherhood. He invited 
  the patriarch of Jerusalem, Teofan, to visit Kiev. As poles thretened to 
  arrest Teofan, he escorted the partiarch together with 3,000 Cossacks. The 
  Cossackdom entered the mainstream of the Ukrainian society. It was state 
  within a state which did not help Cossack/Polish relations. A number of 
  conflicts in 1625, 1630, 1635, 1638 led to the great uprising in 1648 led by 
  Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky (1595-1657). The battles at Zhovti Vody in April-May 
  1648 and at Pyliavtsi in September 1648 demonstrated that the Cossacks army 
  led by Khmelnytsky was in a position to destroy the Commonwealth. 
  Nevertheless, the Ukrainian Hetman accepted an armistice offered by the just 
  elected Polish king Jan Casimir and returned to the Dnipro. Upon his return to 
  Kiev he was greated by the assembled Orthodox hierarchy as "the second Moses". 
  Nevertheless, it was already in the spring of 1649 King Casimir moved his 
  troops against the Cossacks and the War of Independence began. The battles at 
  Zboriv (1649) and&nbsp; Bila Tserkva (1651) led to agreements that were not 
  acceptable to the Cossacks. After a secret meeting at Khmilnytsky residence in 
  Chyhyryn the Cossacks completely demolished the polish army at Batih, but the 
  uprising to succeed some foreign support was necessary.&nbsp; While Ukraine 
  suffered under foreign occupation, Russian influence grew and the 
  incorporation of Ukraine into the Russian empire as a buffer zone against the 
  Ottomans seemed to be a reasonable option for Russians. The common Orthodox 
  faith in predominant parts of Ukraine and Russia was probably one of the 
  decisive factors for Hetman Khmelnytsky&nbsp; to choose Russia for that 
  lacking foreign support in the Ukrainian War of Independence. The choices for 
  the newly formed Ukrainian state were indeed limited as it&nbsp; found itself 
  in the surrounding of a three-sided military rivalry: the Ottoman Turks, who 
  controlled the Tatars to the south of the Ukrainian borders, the Commonwealth 
  of Poland to the west, and the rising state of Muscovy to the east.&nbsp; The 
  result was the faitful treaty signed with Moscow in 1654, the treaty of Pereyaslav, 
  which eventually led to Ukraine's loss of independence. It was already in 1656 
  when the Russian tsar concluded a piece with in Vilnus without even allowing 
  the Ukrainian delegation to get near the negotiations.&nbsp; The treaty of 
  Pereyaslav followed by the 1658 Union of Hadyach which was never really 
  implemented as even before that a 150,000 Russian army led Prince Trubetskoi 
  invaded Ukraine. These treaties were superseded by the 1667 Polish-Russian 
  Treaty of Andrusovo, led to a division of Ukraine for the almost next 300 
  years. Once again Ukraine was not consulted while this agreement was 
  concluded, while Russia never honored this treaty on such sensitive issues as 
  the issue of Kiev. With understanding that they were betrayed, Ukrainian 
  Cossacks were looking for alternative options, but by 1686 all of Ukraine was 
  already divided up among the powers that surrounded it.&nbsp; </font></p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">Despite the partition of Ukraine, an autonomous and 
  well-odered Cossack system of government survived. As many right bank refugees 
  moved the Left Bank of the Dnipro River, the Ukrainian lands around the Left 
  Bank&nbsp; became the center of Ukrainian political and cultural life. This 
  region is known in the Ukrainian history as the Hetmanate (or Hetmanschyna). 
  The Ukrainian Cossacks hoped that, by adopting a loyalist policy to Moscow, 
  they would preserve their autonomy.&nbsp; However, a decisive phase in the 
  relationship of the Hetmanate to Moscow occurred during the hetmancy of Ivan 
  Mazepa (1639-1709), one of the most outstanding and controversial of all 
  Ukrainian political leaders (see O. Subtelny). He was a skillful politician 
  who used his close relations with Peter I to unite the two banks of the Dnipro 
  River after the Cossacks uprising on the Polish-controlled Right Bank in 1702. 
  Recall that in 1700 the Great Northern (twenty-one-year long) War between 
  Russia and Sweden started for control of the Baltic Sea Coast.&nbsp; As 
  unprecedented demands were made upon the Ukrainians by the tsar during the war 
  and the relations between the Hetmanate and Moscow became strained. Hetman 
  Mazepa wrote to Peter I: "From everywhere I received complains against the 
  willfulness of the Russian troops".&nbsp; During this campaign Russian troops 
  were quartered in Ukrainian towns and villages. However, just prior to that, 
  Peter I refused to help Ukrainians in the wake of threat coming from the 
  Polish army under Stanislaw Leszczynsky. Peter I replied to the Hetman: "I 
  cannot even spare ten men; defend yourself as best as you can". In the opinion 
  of Mazepa, the 1654 treaty was effectively annulled by such a reply, and he 
  started looking for alternative alliances for protection of Ukrainian people.&nbsp; 
  As a Ukrainian Hetman,&nbsp; Mazepa was aware of the Khmelnytsky's evaluation 
  of the situation that was created immediately after the 1654 treaty: "The 
  Swedes are an honest people; when they pledge friendship and alliance, they 
  honour their word. However, the Tsar,&nbsp; in establishing an armistice with 
  the Poles and in wishing to return us into their hands, has behaved most 
  heartlessly with us". Hetman Mazepa turned to Sweden for alliance and although 
  the Swedes honoured their word, the battle at Poltava in June 1709 marked the 
  end of Ukrainian attempts to break away from Russia for quite some time.&nbsp; 
  After this defeat, many Cossacs from the Hetmanate, including Mazepa himself, 
  constituted the first Ukrainian political emmigration. The first Ukrainian 
  constitution was compiled by Mazepa's councellor, Pylyp Orlyk. In fact, the "Pacta 
  et Consitutiones" is likely to be the first European constitution. </font></p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">On June 4, 1775, the Russian army led by General 
  Tekeli surrounded the Sich and razed it to the ground.&nbsp; Even after that 
  the word Cossack sent fear to the Russian royalty and Catherine II, when 
  abolishing the Sich, mentioned&nbsp; that " the use of the word 'Zaporozhskiy 
  Cossack' shall be considered by us as an insult to our imperial majesty".&nbsp; 
  What the Russian royalty could not abolish is the Ukrainian spirit, because as 
  it was put by Taras Shevchenko,&nbsp; the Ukrainians "shall never forget the Cossack fame of 
  yore".&nbsp; In the meantime, the subsequent partition of Poland-Lithuania in 
  1772, 1775, and 1795&nbsp; left Ukraine torn apart between the 
  Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.&nbsp; In 1795, the entire 
  Right Bank of the Dnipro River was incorporated into the Russian Empire and 
  the Ukrainian nation-building spirit entered a new stage of its development. 
  Among many "novelties" of the Russian empire,&nbsp; serfdom,&nbsp; absent in 
  the Kievan Rus,&nbsp; was introduced by Catherine II, while by the Elm Ukaz 
  Alexander II banned the use of Ukrainian language in print. This and other 
  similar "novelties" during the Tsar and later during the Soviet time would&nbsp; 
  only strengthen further the Ukrainian spirit and Ukrainians' desire for 
  independence. The World War I led to a short-lived independence of Ukraine, 
  and only&nbsp; in 1991 on August 24&nbsp; the country became independent 
  again.&nbsp; With its millennia long history Ukraine has a lot to be proud of. 
  After all, on a historical scale, for a culture with </font>

  beginnings in a 7000 years old world most advanced&nbsp; civilization,&nbsp; 
  glory of the Kievan Rus, and the national spirit of Ukrainian Cossacks, its 
  several past misfortunes were short lived. It is a young and, at the same time, 
  very old European nation that  has a bright future. </span></p>

  <font color="#ffffff">Regardless of the political changes of the centuries, 
  Ukraine is still as it was many millenniums ago one of the largest and  most beautiful states in Europe. The Ukrainian national emblem is amongst 
  the oldest symbols in Europe. The triden was the first emblem of the Rurik 
  dynasty of the Kievan Rus from the 9th century.&nbsp; It was depicted on coins, royal 
  buildings, weapons, and costumes.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#ffffff">Geographically, Ukraine occupies a central position 
  in Europe (the geographical center of Europe lies near the town of Rakhiv in 
  the Transcarpathian Region of Ukraine). Ukraine's area is 233,088 square miles 
  (603,700 sq. km). It is slightly larger than France. The birthplace of Ukraine 
  was Kievan Rus, one of the most poweful states of medieval Europe, which 
  flourished a thousand years ago. In 988 Prince Volodymyr introduced 
  Christianity as the official state religion. The christening of Kievan Rus 
  took place in Kiev on the bank of the 
  Dnipro River. This move played an important role in Kiev's political 
  development and cultural relations with other European countries. </font>
  </p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff">Ukraine
preserves its past. It is interesting to mention that in the 11th
century, two monks settled in the hills of the Dnipro River to the
south of the city of Kiev, and eventually a cave monastery was
established in the area in 1051. Today this monastery is renowned as
the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves). The Lavra's 86
buildings represent eight centuries of art and architecture. It's now
partially a museum and partially a functioning monastery. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#ffffff">At
the time of Kievan Rus, Kiev, the capital of today's Ukraine, was one
of the richest and most developed cities of Europe. The refined skills
of Kiev's medieval craftsmen has been repeatedly demonstrated by the
vast number of buried treasures found within the territory of the
ancient city, and by its many architectural monuments. St Sofia
Cathedral, the Golden Gate of Kiev , Kiev-Pechersk Lavra are among the
world heritage of human civilization. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#ffffff">Nowadays Ukraine not only boasts of its glorious past 
  and its spectacular nature. The magical voices of Ukrainian singers, ballet 
  artists, the works of Ukrainian painters and sculptors are renown throughout 
  the world. Ukraine is rich in natural resources and has enormous scientific 
  potential. The Dnipro River, with its many tributaries, unifies central Ukraine 
  economically, connecting the Baltic coast countries with the Black Sea and the 
  Mediterranean Sea. The mouth of the Danube River provides an outlet for 
  Ukrainian trade with the Balkans, Austria, and Germany. </font>

  <p><font color="#ffffff">No, it is not Greece. This is the Crimea, an 
  independent state within the boundaries of Ukraine. You see ruins 
  of the city of Chersonese Taurica, 5 B.C. Founded in 422-421 B.C., from 5th to 
  1st c. B.C. Chersonese was a city-state with democratic self-government. 
  During the 1st-4th c. Chersonese became an aristocratic republic under the 
  control of Rome. Since 10th century the history of the city is closely 
  connected with the history of Kievan Rus. In 1299 the city was destroyed by 
  the Tatar-Mongols. You see also Alupka, the mount Ai-Petri, as well as Yalta, the city on the Black Sea known 
  since 12th century. The city is located 79km south of Simferopol, the Crimean 
  capital. The young Mark Twain and the Ukrainian poetess, Lesya Ukrayinka, 
  spent time in Yalta. The city is known to the international community because 
  of the Yalta Conference of February 4-11, 1945, in Livadiya on Mt. Mohabi. The 
  conference was held in the Complex of Palace Structures, built in the Italian 
  Renaissance style with elements of Byzantine, Gothic, and Arabic architecture. 
  Today Yalta is the largest international resort in the Crimea. </font></p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">Where the thousand-year-old east-west trade routes 
  crossed the Dnipro river, there arose the city of Kiev, one of the oldest 
  settlements in Europe. It has given Kiev its primacy as the mother of the 
  cities of an ancient European state and at a high cost in treasure and in 
  human lives, it has made Kiev one of the 
  traditional and practical centres of Europe during the period between 9 and 11 
  centuries. </font></p>

  <p>
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Kyiv has a long, rich, and often stormy history.&nbsp; Archaeological
findings of stone and bone implements, the remains of primitive
dwellings built of wood and skins, and large accumulations of mammoths'
bones indicate that the first settlements in the vicinity date from the
Upper Paleolithic Period (some 15,000 to 40,000 years ago). As early as
3000 BC in the Neolithic Period and subsequently at the time of the
Cucuteni-Trypillya culture at the end of the Neolithic, tribes engaged
in agriculture and animal husbandry lived on the site of modern Kyiv.
The tribes of the area traded with the nomadic peoples of the steppes
to the south, Scythians, Sarmatians, and later Khazars, and also with
the ancient Greek colonies that were located on the Black Sea coast.</span></p>

  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">There is an old legend which tells us about
  three brothers and their sister who founded 
  Kiev at the end of the fifth century. The brothers Kiy, Khoriv, and Shchek, 
  along with their sister, Lybid, decided to name this newly founded land 
  "Kyiv", after their elder brother. Kiev was well-known to colonists and 
  traders in the ancient world, including Greeks and Romans. Situated on 
  lucrative trade routes ("from the Varangians to the Greeks"), the city quickly 
  prospered as the center of a powerful European state, Kievan Rus. Kiev bloomed 
  during the end of the ninth century as a political and cultural center in 
  Europe. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman">Nowadays
Kiev has much to offer in the cultural and architectural arenas with
its wide tree-lined boulevards and historical buildings reflecting
various styles and periods of the ancient Kievan Rus state. Many
architectural monuments within the territory of the ancient city still
grace the Kiev skyline: St. Sofia Cathedral, the Golden Gate of Kiev ,
the architectural ensemble of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra , and many
others. The origins of the Kyiv-Pechersk Monastery are closely related
to the introduction of Christianity in Kyiv Rus' in the 10-th century.
To keep the new religion alive Princes built impressive churches and by
all means supported the activity of the first monks who went from place
to place teaching the Christian Faith, preaching and settling centers
of the worship. The monastery itself was settled in the underground
caves on the high bank of river Dnipro during the reign of Prince
Yaroslav the Wise (1091-1054). "Caves" in Ukrainian will be "pechery",
hence the name of the monastery. During the next ten centuries the
Monastery played a significant role in the cultural and religious life
of the country and its history was full of interesting events. Many
famous people had deep connection to Lavra. Nowadays Lavra is both a
collection of unique museums and a functioning monastery. </font>
